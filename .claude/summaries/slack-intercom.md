This session is being continued from a previous
    conversation that ran out of context. The
    conversation is summarized below:
    Analysis:
    Let me analyze this conversation chronologically to
    capture all technical details, user requests, and
    code changes:

    1. **Initial Request**: User wanted to create a
    bidirectional Intercom â†” Slack integration where new
     Intercom messages appear in Slack, and Slack thread
    replies go back to Intercom.

    2. **Implementation Phase**: I created multiple
    files:
       - `/web/pages/api/intercom.ts` - webhook endpoint
    for receiving Intercom notifications
       - `/web/pages/api/slack-events.ts` - event handler
     for Slack user messages in threads
       - `/web/lib/intercom-slack-service.ts` - service
    layer for API calls
       - Database migration for message mappings

    3. **Testing and Debugging**: We used live logging to
     debug multiple issues:
       - Webhook signature verification (temporarily
    disabled)
       - Database connection (switched from Supabase
    client to dbExecute)
       - Message parsing from Intercom webhook structure
       - Threading implementation (switched from webhooks
     to Web API)
       - First message handling (added
    conversation.user.created support)

    4. **Production Deployment Issue**: The main issue
    was that in production, the Slack bot gets
    "not_in_channel" error even though the channel test
    shows `"is_member": false`.

    5. **Enhancement Requests**: User asked for metadata
    in messages and attachment handling, which I
    implemented.

    6. **Final Discovery**: User discovered that
    production uses a different Slack bot token than the
    local environment, which explains the
    "not_in_channel" error.

    7. **Most Recent Work**: I was debugging the
    production issue and added automatic channel joining
    logic to the service. I was about to check build
    issues when the user discovered the token mismatch.

    The conversation shows a progression from initial
    implementation to debugging production issues, with
    the final resolution being that different
    environments use different bot tokens.

    Summary:
    1. Primary Request and Intent:
       Create a bidirectional integration between
    Intercom and Slack where:
       - New Intercom messages automatically appear as
    notifications in Slack
       - When users reply in Slack threads, those replies
     are sent back to the corresponding Intercom
    conversation
       - The system should maintain conversation
    threading context between both platforms
       - Include metadata like email, user ID, and
    attachments in Slack messages
       - Handle both first messages and subsequent
    replies properly
       - User also requested to clean up build issues and
     get the codebase in review-ready state

    2. Key Technical Concepts:
       - Intercom Webhooks API for receiving conversation
     events
       - Slack Web API for posting messages with
    threading support
       - Slack Events API for capturing user thread
    replies
       - Database mapping system to link Intercom
    conversations to Slack threads
       - Webhook signature verification for security
       - PostgreSQL database operations using dbExecute
    utility
       - Next.js API routes for webhook endpoints
       - TypeScript interfaces for API payload structures
       - Vercel production deployment environment
       - Environment variable configuration across
    development and production
       - OAuth scopes for Slack bot permissions
    (channels:write, channels:join)

    3. Files and Code Sections:
       - `/web/pages/api/intercom.ts`
         - Webhook endpoint for receiving Intercom
    notifications
         - Processes `conversation.user.created`,
    `conversation.user.replied`, and
    `conversation.admin.replied` events
         - Enhanced to handle first messages from
    `source` field vs `conversation_parts`
         - Key code for first message handling:
         ```typescript
         if (webhookData.topic ===
    "conversation.user.created" &&
    conversation.source?.body) {
           messageContent = conversation.source.body;
           authorInfo = conversation.source.author;
           messageId = conversation.source.id;
           attachments = conversation.source.attachments
    || [];
         }
         ```

       - `/web/pages/api/slack-events.ts`
         - Event handler for Slack user messages in
    threads
         - Processes `message.channels` events with
    thread_ts
         - Looks up conversation mappings and sends
    replies to Intercom
         - Includes bot message filtering to prevent
    loops
         - Key filtering logic:
         ```typescript
         if (event.user === "USLACKBOT" || !event.user ||
     event.user === "U[REDACTED]") {
           console.log("Skipping bot message to avoid
    loops");
           return res.status(200).json({ message: "Bot
    message ignored" });
         }
         ```

       - `/web/lib/intercom-slack-service.ts`
         - Service layer managing all Slack and Intercom
    API calls
         - Enhanced with metadata, attachment handling,
    and debugging logs
         - Most recent addition - automatic channel
    joining logic:
         ```typescript
         if (channelTestData.ok &&
    !channelTestData.channel.is_member) {
           console.log("Bot is not a member, attempting
    to join channel...");
           const joinResponse = await
    fetch("https://slack.com/api/conversations.join", {
             method: "POST",
             headers: {
               "Authorization": `Bearer
    ${slackBotToken}`,
               "Content-Type":
    "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
             },
             body: `channel=${slackChannelId}`
           });
         }
         ```

       - `/web/.env`
         - Environment configuration with all credentials
         - Contains critical environment variables:
         ```
         INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN="[REDACTED]"
         SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-[REDACTED]"
         SLACK_CHANNEL_ID="C[REDACTED]"
         SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET="[REDACTED]"
         ```

    4. Errors and fixes:
       - **Supabase client error**: Fixed by switching
    from `createClient` to existing `dbExecute` utility
       - **Invalid thread_ts format**: Slack webhooks
    returned timestamps without decimal points; fixed by
    switching to Slack Web API
       - **Message parsing issues**: Fixed by
    understanding Intercom webhook structure uses
    `conversation_parts` array for replies but `source`
    for first messages
       - **Threading not working**: Slack webhooks don't
    support threading; switched to Web API with
    `chat.postMessage`
       - **First messages showing "No message content"**:
     Fixed by checking `webhookData.topic ===
    "conversation.user.created"` and using
    `conversation.source.body`
       - **Production "not_in_channel" error**: Root
    cause identified - production uses different Slack
    bot token than local environment

    5. Problem Solving:
       Successfully implemented live log monitoring,
    resolved webhook signature verification, fixed
    database integration, implemented proper message
    content extraction, added metadata and attachment
    handling. The major breakthrough was discovering that
     production and local environments use different
    Slack bot tokens, explaining the "not_in_channel"
    error. Added automatic channel joining logic to
    handle future bot membership issues.

    6. All user messages:
       - "in web/pages/api/intercom.ts I want to create
    something that when a new intercom message comes into
     intercom I get a message in slack. and then if i
    reply in the thread it replies to that message in
    intercom. How can I do that?"
       - "sorry can you reapply i accidentally deleted it
     again"
       - "signing secret:
    [REDACTED]"
       - "sorry what is the topic for intercom. I have
    ngrok setup https://[REDACTED].ngrok-free.app"
       - "should i do created and replied?"
       - "great thanks! I was only able to find intercom
    access token here:"
       - "[REDACTED]"
       - Various debugging and testing messages about
    logs, channels, and functionality
       - "can you add more meta data in the initial
    message like email and anything else that might be
    relevant."
       - "if an image is attached can you forward that to
     slack too or is it really hard? I just tried in
    logs.txt"
       - "its not showing that's okay can you just send a
     message saying "there was an image" or something"
       - "also yarn build is failing in the web directory
     can you clean up the build make it work and get this
     branch in a good review state"
       - "hmm when testing in prd i am getting ack API
    error: not_in_channel"
       - "it works when doing ngrok but on prod i am
    getting this Slack API error: not_in_channel. the env
     is the exact same :( I dont know what is wrong"
       - "okay here is the new logs... do you see
    anything?"
       - "i did option 1 and getting this [production
    logs showing not_in_channel error]"
       - "ohhhh it's a different key!!!"

    7. Pending Tasks:
       - Fix yarn build issues for review-ready state
       - Update production environment variables to use
    correct Slack bot token OR add production bot to
    channel
       - Remove debugging logs once production issue is
    resolved
       - Clean up codebase for review readiness

    8. Current Work:
       I was debugging the production Slack
    "not_in_channel" error by adding automatic channel
    joining logic to
    `/web/lib/intercom-slack-service.ts`. I had just
    implemented code to detect when the bot isn't a
    member and automatically join the channel. The user
    then discovered that production uses a different
    Slack bot token than the local environment, which
    explains the issue. I was about to check yarn build
    issues when the user made this discovery.
