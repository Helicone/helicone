# `html-rewriter-wasm`

An implementation of
[HTMLRewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter)
using a WebAssembly version of
[lol-html](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html/). This was primarily written
for [üî• Miniflare](https://github.com/mrbbot/miniflare), but may be useful for
other projects too. Many thanks to [@inikulin](https://github.com/inikulin) for
their work on
[lol-html's JavaScript API](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html/tree/master/js-api)
which this package's Rust code is based on.

## Features

- üîã Supports all handler types, properties and methods
- ‚è∞ Supports synchronous and asynchronous handlers
- üìå Supports class handlers with correctly bound methods

## Usage

```js
import { HTMLRewriter } from "html-rewriter-wasm";

const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

let output = "";
const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter((outputChunk) => {
  output += decoder.decode(outputChunk);
});

rewriter.on("p", {
  element(element) {
    element.setInnerContent("new");
  },
});

try {
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>old</p>"));
  await rewriter.end();
  console.log(output); // <p>new</p>
} finally {
  rewriter.free(); // Remember to free memory
}
```

See [test/index.ts](./test/index.ts) for a more traditional `HTMLRewriter`
implementation that doesn't have the caveats listed below, but restricts input
and output to strings.

To enable the
[`html_rewriter_treats_esi_include_as_void_tag`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/compatibility-dates#htmlrewriter-handling-of-esiinclude)
compatibility flag, set `enableEsiTags` when constructing the `HTMLRewriter`:

```js
const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter((outputChunk) => { ... }, {
  enableEsiTags: true,
});
```

## Caveats

- Once `write` or `end` has been called, you cannot add any more handlers. You
  must register all handlers before you start transforming:

  ```js
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter(...);

  // ‚ùå
  rewriter.on("h1", { ... });
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<h1>1</h1"));
  rewriter.on("p", { ... }); // not allowed
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>"));

  // ‚úÖ
  rewriter.on("h1", { ... });
  rewriter.on("p", { ... });
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<h1>1</h1"));
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>"));
  ```

- `end` may only be called once per `HTMLRewriter` instance. This means you must
  create a new `HTMLRewriter` instance for each transformation:

  ```js
  // ‚ùå
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  await rewriter.end();
  await rewriter.end(); // not allowed

  // ‚úÖ
  const rewriter1 = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  await rewriter1.end();
  const rewriter2 = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  await rewriter2.end();
  ```

- When using `async` handlers, you must always `await` calls to `write` and
  `end` before calling them again. In other words, you cannot have concurrent
  `write` and `end` calls:

  ```js
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter(...).on("p", {
    async element(element) {
      await fetch(...);
      element.setInnerContent("new");
    }
  });

  // ‚ùå
  rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>1</p>"));
  rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>")); // not allowed

  // ‚ùå
  const promise1 = rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>1</p>"));
  const promise2 = rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>"));
  await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]); // not allowed

  // ‚úÖ
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>1</p>"));
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>"));
  ```

## Internals

`lol-html` doesn't natively support asynchronous handlers. Instead, whenever a
handler returns a `Promise`, we have to unwind the WebAssembly stack into
temporary storage, wait for the promise to resolve, then rewind the stack and
continue parsing. This temporary storage is per `HTMLRewriter` instance, hence
we cannot have concurrent `write` and `end` calls. We use the
[Asyncify](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/Asyncify.cpp)
feature of [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) to implement
this. See
[this article](https://kripken.github.io/blog/wasm/2019/07/16/asyncify.html) for
more details.

## Building

You can build the package by running `npm run build`. You must do this prior to
running tests with `npm test`.

You **must** have mrbbot's fork of wasm-pack installed. This upgrades binaryen
(wasm-opt) to version_92 which exports `asyncify_get_state`:

```shell
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/mrbbot/wasm-pack
$ npm run build
$ npm test
```
