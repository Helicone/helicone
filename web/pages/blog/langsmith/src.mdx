## Introduction

Both Helicone and LangSmith are capable, powerful DevOps platform used by enterprises and developers to develop, deploy and monitor their LLM applications and gain full visibility into their¬†development. **But which is better?**

With Helicone, the experience of observing and monitoring your LLM is intuitive and integrates well into any LLM observability tech stack. Being a Gateway, we are able to offer caching, prompt threat detection, moderation, vault, rate limiting, customer portal and other useful observability features. As a bonus, integrating with Helicone is as simple as adding two lines of code.

*LangSmith is a great tool and there are some things we would recommend them over Helicone for, such as if you‚Äôre an enterprise that uses LangChain, develops AI agents, or prefers async solutions.*

## Acting as a Gateway

The biggest difference between LangSmith and Helicone is how we log your data. Helicone is Gateway whereas LangSmith is an async solution. To integrate with Helicone, it‚Äôs as easy as changing the base URL to point to Helicone, and we‚Äôll handle every call you make. As a cherry on top, Helicone exists to fit into any existing tech stack. A minor difference is that LangSmith tracks logs per trace, Helicone tracks logs per request and can support extremely large request bodies.

### Access to Gateway Features

By using Helicone, you get access to <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" target="_blank">caching</a>, <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-rate-limits" target="_blank">rate limiting</a>, <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/vault" target="_blank">API key management</a>, <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/llm-security" target="_blank">threat detection</a>, <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/moderations" target="_blank">moderations</a> and many more. For example, Helicone customers use caching to test and save money by making fewer calls to OpenAI and other models. B2B customers also use us to rate limit their customers and stay compliant by storing OpenAI keys in Helicone vaults. 

### What about latency that comes with being a Gateway? 

We know how much latency matters to our users. We deploy on the edge using Cloudflare Workers to minimize time to response. This adds only ~50 ms from about 95% of the world‚Äôs Internet-connected population (check out <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/" target="_blank">Cloudflare's stats</a>), for us to bring the additional features and convenience to you. 

Still not sure which one is better? Check out this update on how <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2024-community-update" target="_blank"> Cloudflare selected Helicone as 1 of the 29 startups</a> for the Cloudflare Workers Launchpad this cohort. 


### Just Some Stats

In the last 8 months, Helicone has not had any Gateway incidents with **99.9999% uptime** ‚Äî that‚Äôs pretty good. Whether or not you take that into consideration, we want to give you peace of mind.
