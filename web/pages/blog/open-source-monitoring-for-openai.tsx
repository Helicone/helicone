            Why Traditional Monitoring Falls Short
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-6">
            Traditional monitoring solutions, while serviceable, were designed
            for linear and time-based data. They are not equipped to handle the
            complexities of OpenAI&apos;s token-based system. As a result, they
            fail to provide the insights necessary to optimize OpenAI usage.
            Below is a table detailing some differences between traditional
            observability compared to LLM-observability:
