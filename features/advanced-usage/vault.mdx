## Introduction

The Key Vault is designed to securely store provider API keys (from OpenAI and future providers). It offers seamless integration with Helicone proxy keys for enhanced management.

### Why Key Vault

- **Simplified Key Management**: Use a single key with Helicone, eliminating the need to manage both a Helicone auth and an OpenAI key.
- **Enhanced Security**: Distribute Helicone keys to ensure users interact through our Helicone proxy.
- **Prevent Bypass**: Eliminate the need to distribute OpenAI keys directly, which could allow users to bypass our valuable logging and monitoring.
- **Flexible Resource Allocation**:
  - **For Hackathons:** Easily distribute AI credits to participants and implement rate limiting.
  - **For Companies:** Allocate and control AI usage credits for employees or departments.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Store your Provider Keys

1. Navigate to the `Developer` tab > `Vault` > `Add Provider Key`.
2. Enter your provider key and assign a **unique** name to it for easy identification.
3. Click `Create Provider Key`.

<Note>
  Currently, Helicone supports storing OpenAI Provider Keys. We plan to expand
  support to include other providers in the future.

<Accordion title="How we encrypt your Provider Key securely">
  At Helicone, we implement transparent column encryption using the `XChaCha20
  cryptographic algorithm` with `nonce support` to securely encrypt all keys at
  rest, ensuring an extra layer of protection.

### Step 2: Generate Proxy Keys for Your Team

1. On the same `Vault` page, click `Create Proxy Key`.
2. Create a name and select your provider key from the dropdown menu.
3. Click `Create Proxy Key`.

Helicone will generate a unique proxy key for you. This proxy key functions as an authorization Bearer token when making requests.

<Tip>
  **You can have several proxy keys mapped to one provider key.** This
  flexibility is especially useful for large teams or segmented projects.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Store the Proxy Key Safely

Copy the key and store it in a secure location. You can now share this key with your team members.

<Warning>
  **Make sure to copy and safely store the generated proxy key immediately.** The
  key uses one-way hashing, which means if you lose it, you'll need to generate
  a new one.
</Warning>

## Important Notes

- **Supported Keys:** Currently, you can store OpenAI Provider Keys securely in Helicone. We plan to expand support to include additional providers.
- **Multiple Proxy Keys**: You can create several proxy keys mapped to a single provider key. This flexibility is particularly useful for large teams or segmented projects.
- **Safekeeping**: Copy and store the generated proxy key immediately in a secure location. Because it uses one-way hashing, you'll need to generate a new key if you lose the original.
- **Performance**: There is a minor increase in latency for requests because Helicone validates the proxy key authentication before retrieving the actual provider key. This additional step ensures enhanced security and proper routing.
