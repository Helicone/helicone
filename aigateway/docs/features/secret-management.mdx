# Secret Management

Conduit provides multiple secure methods for managing API keys and sensitive configuration across all your LLM providers. Choose the approach that best fits your deployment and security requirements.

## Available Methods

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables (Default)" icon="terminal">
    **Recommended for development and simple deployments**
    
    Conduit automatically discovers provider API keys from environment variables using a standard naming convention.
    
    ### Required Environment Variables
    
    Set up your .env file with your PROVIDER_API_KEYs:

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
    ```
    
    ### How it works
    
    1. Conduit reads your load balancing configuration
    2. For each configured provider, it looks for `{PROVIDER_NAME}_API_KEY`
    3. Keys are securely wrapped in `Secret<T>` to prevent accidental logging
    4. Missing keys will cause startup to fail with clear error messages
    
    **Best for:** Development, Docker containers, simple production deployments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Storage" icon="database">
    **Multi-tenant deployments with per-organization keys**
    
    Store encrypted provider keys in PostgreSQL for organization-specific API key management.
    
    ### Database Schema
    
    ```sql
    -- Conduit uses encrypted storage for provider keys
    SELECT * FROM decrypted_provider_keys 
    WHERE org_id = $1 AND provider_name = $2;
    ```
    
    ### Features
    
    - **Encrypted at rest** - Keys are encrypted in the database
    - **Organization isolation** - Each org can use different provider keys  
    - **Automatic decryption** - Conduit handles encryption/decryption transparently
    - **Audit trail** - Track which keys are used by which organizations
    
    ### Configuration
    
    ```yaml
    # config.yaml
    discover:
      api-keys-source: database  # Switch from default 'env'
    
    database:
      url: "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/conduit"
    ```
    
    **Best for:** Multi-tenant SaaS deployments, enterprise installations

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rotation Strategy" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Regular Key Rotation** - Rotate provider API keys monthly - Use separate
    keys for dev/staging/prod - Monitor key usage and expiration
  </Card>

  <Card title="Access Control" icon="shield-halved">
    **Principle of Least Privilege** - Limit key permissions at provider level -
    Use separate keys per environment - Audit key access regularly
  </Card>

  <Card title="Monitoring" icon="chart-line">
    **Observability** - Monitor API key usage patterns - Set up alerts for
    failed authentications - Track costs per key/organization
  </Card>

  <Card title="Backup & Recovery" icon="floppy-disk">
    **Key Management** - Backup encrypted keys securely - Document key recovery
    procedures - Test disaster recovery plans
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Coming Soon

<Note>
  The following secret management integrations are planned for future releases:
</Note>

### AWS Secrets Manager _(v2)_

**Enterprise-grade secret management with AWS integration**

```yaml
# Future configuration
discover:
  api-keys-source: aws-secrets-manager

secrets-manager:
  region: us-west-2
  secret-prefix: "conduit/providers/"
  auto-rotation: true
```

**Planned features:**

- Automatic secret rotation
- Cross-region replication
- IAM-based access control
- CloudTrail audit logging
- KMS encryption at rest

### HashiCorp Vault _(v3)_

**Multi-cloud secret management with Vault integration**

### Azure Key Vault _(v3)_

**Microsoft Azure secret management integration**

## Migration Guide

### From Environment Variables to Database

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backup existing keys">
    Export your current environment variables to a secure file for backup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update configuration">
    Change `discover.api-keys-source` from `env` to `database` in your config.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Insert keys into database">
    Use Conduit's admin API or SQL to insert encrypted provider keys.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and verify">
    Verify all providers work with database-stored keys before removing env
    vars.
  </Step>
</Steps>
