We're excited to re-introduce **Helicone self-hosting**! Now you can deploy our powerful observability platform directly within your own infrastructure with a single Docker command.

This update addresses the needs of organizations with strict security and compliance requirements, allowing you to leverage Helicone's insights into your LLM usage without sending sensitive data to third-party servers.

### Why self-host?

- **Complete Data Sovereignty**: Keep all LLM interactions and analytics within your security perimeter.
- **Protection of Intellectual Property**: Ensure proprietary prompts and model data never leave your infrastructure.
- **Customized Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with your internal systems and security protocols.
- **Cost Efficiency at Scale**: Favorable economics for high-volume LLM request processing.

Get started with a single Docker command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Helicone/helicone.git

# See your Helicone dashboard in localhost:3000!
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```
