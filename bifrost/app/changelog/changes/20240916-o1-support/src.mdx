## Immediate Support for OpenAI's o1 Models

We're excited to announce support for OpenAI's new o1 models, along with comprehensive tracking of token counts and spending.

### What Are o1 Models?

OpenAI's o1 models represent a significant advancement in language AI. They use reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning tasks, generating an internal chain of thought before producing a final response. This leads to enhanced performance and new capabilities for your applications.

### Accurate Cost Tracking

Our platform now fully supports cost tracking for o1 model usage. Due to the unique way these models process information, it's important to provide token counts for both input and output to ensure accurate cost calculations.

### How to Ensure Accurate Tracking

- **Using Integrations:** If you're using integrations like Langchain, LlamaIndex, or LiteLLM, token usage is automatically tracked.
- **Streaming Usage:** For accurate cost calculation while streaming, refer to our guide on [Correct Cost Calculation While Streaming](https://docs.helicone.ai/use-cases/enable-stream-usage).
