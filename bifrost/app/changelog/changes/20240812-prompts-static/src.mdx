We've added a new `hpstatic` function to our [Helicone Prompt Formatter (HPF) package](https://github.com/Helicone/prompts). This function allows users to create static prompts that don't change between requests, which is particularly useful for system prompts or other constant text. The `hpstatic` function wraps the text in `<helicone-prompt-static>` tags, indicating to Helicone that this part of the prompt should not be treated as variable input.

Here's a quick example of how to use `hpstatic`:

```typescript
import { hpf, hpstatic } from "@helicone/prompts";

const systemPrompt = hpstatic`You are a helpful assistant.`;
const userPrompt = hpf`Write a story about ${{ character }}`;

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
      { role: "user", content: userPrompt },
    ],
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
    },
  }
);
```

This new feature enhances our prompt management capabilities, allowing for more flexible and efficient prompt structuring in your applications.
