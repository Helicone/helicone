We're excited to announce our integration with Perplexity AI, bringing powerful observability tools to your Perplexity model implementations! Get started with just two simple steps:

1. Generate a write-only API key in your Helicone account.
2. Update your Perplexity AI base URL to:
   ```
   https://perplexity.helicone.ai
   ```

That's all it takes! Now you can monitor, analyze, and optimize your Perplexity AI models with Helicone's comprehensive insights.
