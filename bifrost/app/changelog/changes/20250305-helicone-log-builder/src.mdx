We're excited to introduce the `HeliconeLogBuilder`, a new approach to handling streaming responses with better error handling and a simplified workflow.

### Introducing HeliconeLogBuilder

The new `HeliconeLogBuilder` class provides a simplified way to handle streaming LLM responses with improved error handling and async support. This new approach makes it easier to:

- Handle errors gracefully with the `setError` method
- Simplify stream handling with the `toReadableStream` method
- Use more flexible async/await patterns with `sendLog`
- Track proper error status codes

### Example Usage with Next.js App Router

```typescript
import { HeliconeManualLogger } from "@helicone/helpers";
import { after } from "next/server";
import Together from "together-ai";

const together = new Together();
const helicone = new HeliconeManualLogger({
  apiKey: process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY!,
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { question } = await request.json();
  const body = {
    model: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: question }],
    stream: true,
  };

  const heliconeLogBuilder = helicone.logBuilder(body, {
    "Helicone-Property-Environment": "dev",
  });

  try {
    const response = await together.chat.completions.create(body);
    return new Response(heliconeLogBuilder.toReadableStream(response));
  } catch (error) {
    heliconeLogBuilder.setError(error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    after(async () => {
      // This will be executed after the response is sent to the client
      await heliconeLogBuilder.sendLog();
    });
  }
}
```

### Benefits Over Previous Methods

The `logBuilder` approach offers several advantages over the previous streaming methods:

- **Better Error Handling**: Automatically captures and logs errors with the `setError` method
- **Simplified Stream Handling**: Combines stream processing and logging in one step
- **More Flexible Async Patterns**: Better support for async workflows with the `sendLog` method
- **Proper Status Code Tracking**: Accurately records HTTP status codes, including errors
- **Improved Time-to-First-Token Metrics**: More reliable tracking of streaming performance

This new approach is now the recommended way to handle streaming responses with Helicone. For more information, check out our [Manual Logger with Streaming](https://docs.helicone.ai/guides/cookbooks/manual-logger-streaming) guide.
