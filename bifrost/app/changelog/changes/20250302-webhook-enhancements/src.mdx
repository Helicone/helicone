We've enhanced our webhook functionality to improve integration with external systems:

- **Combined Request/Response URL**: Replaced separate URLs with a single `request_response_url` field that contains both request and response data in one object.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced S3 URL generation calls from two to one per webhook.
- **Configurable Data Inclusion**: Added `includeData` parameter to the webhook API to control whether enhanced data is included in payloads.
- **Updated Documentation**: Added examples showing how to work with the combined data structure.

These changes make webhook integration more efficient while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations.
