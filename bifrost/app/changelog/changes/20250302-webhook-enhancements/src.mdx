We've made significant improvements to our webhook functionality to enhance integration capabilities and performance:

- **Unified Request/Response URL**: Webhooks now provide a single `request_response_url` field that contains both request and response data in one object, simplifying data retrieval and processing.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced the number of S3 URL generation calls, improving webhook delivery speed and reliability.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated documentation with detailed examples of the combined data structure, making it easier to understand and implement webhook consumers.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of edge cases and error conditions in the webhook delivery process.

These enhancements make it easier to integrate Helicone webhooks with your systems while providing more comprehensive data for analysis and automation.
