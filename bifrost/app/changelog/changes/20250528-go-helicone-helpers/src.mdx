We're thrilled to announce that we now have a <a href="https://github.com/helicone/go-helicone-helpers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go SDK for Helicone's Helpers Package</a>. You can now integrate any custom LLM with Helicone using the Go Manual Logger. Install it now with:

```
go get github.com/helicone/go-helicone-helpers
```

Refer to our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/manual-logger-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a> on how to use it.
