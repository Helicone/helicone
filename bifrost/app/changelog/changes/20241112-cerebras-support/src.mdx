## Cerebras Integration

We're excited to announce the addition of Cerebras as a new model provider on our platform. This integration expands our suite of available AI models and provides more options for our users.

### Getting Started

To start using Cerebras models, create an account on [Cerebras](https://cerebras.ai/) and then create a new API key. Once you have your API key, you can add it to your Helicone configuration as a base_url.

```
base_url="https://cerebras.helicone.ai/v1"
```

For detailed API documentation, please refer to our updated [docs](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/cerebras).
