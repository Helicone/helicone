Helicone now integrates seamlessly with LangGraph, enabling comprehensive observability for your graph-based AI agents and tools. With minimal configuration, you can get full visibility into your LangGraph workflows, from basic chains to complex multi-agent systems.

## Why This Matters
LangGraph has emerged as a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-agent LLM applications. Our integration gives you:

- Complete visibility into every LLM call within your graph
- Session tracking for understanding full conversation flows
- Performance metrics to identify bottlenecks in complex agent interactions
- Cost monitoring across your entire agent ecosystem

## How It Works

The integration works by configuring your LangChain models to route through Helicone's observability layer with just a few lines of code:

```javascript
// Initialize OpenAI model with Helicone integration
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  modelName: "gpt-4o",
  configuration: {
    baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    defaultHeaders: {
      "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
      "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", // Optional caching
    },
  },
});
```

Then add custom properties to trace specific agent behaviors:

```javascript
// Add tracing info to agent invocations
const result = await agent.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("what is the current weather in sf")] },
  {
    options: {
      headers: {
        "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "weather-query",
        "Helicone-Session-Id": uuidv4(),
        "Helicone-Session-Name": "weather-session", 
      },
    },
  }
);
```

## Supported Models

The integration works with all major LLM providers supported by LangChain, including:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- And more to come!
