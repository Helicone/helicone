We've completely redesigned the online evaluators creation and editing experience, making it more intuitive and powerful than ever. The new interface guides developers through the process with real-time feedback and advanced configuration options.

## What's new

- **Streamlined form layout**: A cleaner, more organized and intuitive interface
- **Advanced configuration**: More granular control over your evaluator settings
- **Real-time feedback**: Helpful validation messages to guide you through the setup
- **Enhanced user experience**: Every step of creating evaluators is now more straightforward

## Getting started

1. Navigate to the <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/evaluators" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Evaluators</a> tab in Helicone
2. Click "Create New Evaluator" or edit an existing one
