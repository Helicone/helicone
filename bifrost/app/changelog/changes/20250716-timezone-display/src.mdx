We've improved how timestamps are displayed throughout the Helicone dashboard to provide a better user experience for teams working across different timezones.

## What's New

- **Automatic Timezone Detection**: Requests now display in your local timezone automatically
- **Clear Timezone Indicators**: Timestamps now clearly show the timezone being used
- **Consistent Formatting**: Improved date/time formatting across all views

This update makes it easier for distributed teams to collaborate and analyze their LLM usage patterns without timezone confusion.
