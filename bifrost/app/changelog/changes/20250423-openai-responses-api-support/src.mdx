Helicone now supports OpenAI's new Responses API, allowing you to monitor and analyze your model's responses seamlessly.

### What is the OpenAI Responses API?

The OpenAI Responses API enables you to provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs by calling your own custom code or using built-in tools like web search or file search.

### Integrating with Helicone

1. Create a Helicone account and API key. 
2. Set environment variables
3. Install the OpenAI SDK:
    ```bash
    npm install openai
    ```
4. Configure your OpenAI client to use the Helicone proxy:
    ```typescript
    import OpenAI from "openai";

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
      baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1", // Route requests through Helicone
      defaultHeaders: {
        "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`, // Authenticate with Helicone
      },
    });
    ```

With this setup, any calls to the OpenAI Responses API will be automatically logged and monitored by Helicone.
