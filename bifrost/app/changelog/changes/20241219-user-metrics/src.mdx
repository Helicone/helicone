We're excited to introduce User Histograms, a powerful new visualization tool that helps you understand user behavior patterns across your LLM applications.

### Key Features

- **Distribution Visualization**: See how your users are distributed across different metrics like token usage, costs, and request volumes
- **Percentile Analysis**: Quickly identify power users and understand usage patterns at different percentiles
- **Interactive Filtering**: Filter and segment your user data to focus on specific time periods or user groups

### Use Cases

1. **Usage Pattern Analysis**

   - Identify usage clusters and understand how different user segments interact with your LLM applications
   - Spot outliers and investigate unusual usage patterns

2. **Cost Optimization**

   - Understand cost distribution across your user base
   - Make informed decisions about pricing tiers and usage limits

3. **Capacity Planning**
   - Analyze token usage patterns to better predict and plan for scaling
   - Understand peak usage patterns across your user base
