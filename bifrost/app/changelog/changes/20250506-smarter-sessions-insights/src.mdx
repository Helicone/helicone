We've introduced a new design for Sessions, now with session-level metrics, smarter filters, and a cleaner UI.

The new Sessions include **average latency**, **total cost**, and **improved time filtering**, making it easier to debug multi-step LLM workflows. The UI has also been refined for a cleaner and more intuitive experience.

Try it out in <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sessions</a>, we'd love to hear your feedback!
