We're excited to announce support for tracking [AWS Bedrock models](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) requests through Helicone

### How to track your requests?

To track your Bedrock requests through Helicone, you can set the Bedrock client's endpoint to use the Helicone Proxy.

```
endpoint="https://bedrock.helicone.ai/v1/<region>"
```

For detailed API documentation, please refer to our updated [docs](https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/bedrock/javascript).
