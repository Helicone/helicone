## Analyzing Complex AI Agent Costs and Performance

Wordware.ai builds a no-code platform for creating AI-powered workflows that can be used for automations or integrated as core infrastructure in other products. These workflows involve multiple LLM calls that need to be tracked and analyzed for cost management and debugging.

> Our customers put together LLM-powered workflows that they either use for automations or as part of their core infrastructure. We essentially encapsulate all the AI parts of their product into our platform, into a single API call.

The challenge was efficiently analyzing costs and performance of specific workflow runs. When customers asked questions like "How much did this particular set of runs cost?" or needed to debug specific LLM outputs, Wordware's team had to manually extract and calculate data, downloading CSVs and processing them separately.


## The Debugging Breakthrough

> We use you guys all the time. I find you guys awesome and I'm pretty sure everyone else here really appreciates what you guys do. You're top of the line.

Implementing Helicone's observability platform transformed Wordware's ability to track and analyze their LLM usage. The comprehensive data collection provides visibility into every aspect of their AI workflows, from costs to performance metrics.

This visibility is critical for cost analysis and prompt debugging—two of Wordware's most common use cases. Whether it's calculating customer usage costs or investigating unexpected LLM outputs, Helicone provides the data they need to support their customers.


## Impact and Efficiency

For Wordware's team, Helicone has become an essential tool in their development workflow:

| **Before Helicone** | **With Helicone** |
| --- | --- |
| Manual calculation of workflow costs by downloading and processing CSVs | Centralized visibility of all LLM calls and associated costs in one platform |
| Limited insight into which prompts were used in specific workflow runs | Ability to filter and search through requests to identify specific runs or patterns |
| Difficulty correlating LLM calls with specific customer workflows | Organization-level filtering to focus on specific customer data |
| Time-consuming process to gather metrics for customer inquiries | Faster access to key metrics through the dashboard and request filtering |

Helicone's platform has become foundational to Wordware's operations, providing the observability and analytics they need to support their customers while continuously improving their AI-powered workflow platform.
