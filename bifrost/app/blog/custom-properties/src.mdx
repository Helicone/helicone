## What are Custom Properties?

Custom Properties are metadata that you can attach to your LLM requests. In Helicone, you can tag your requests with specific information to create **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>detailed segments of your data</span>**, such as session/conversation/app IDs, the prompt chain or metadata about the user who made the request. 

**In this blog, we'll explore:**
- the importance of custom properties, and how they enable a deeper understanding of user behavior, preferences, and patterns. 
- how you can tailor your services for your customers to **drive business growth**. 
- how companies like **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Journalist AI</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Greptile</span>** use custom properties for user analysis.


## Use Case 1: Environment Tracking 
    
Tracking environments in Helicone allows you to monitor and differentiate between various operational stages such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`. 
    

### Implementation

```python
openai.Completion.create(
    # ...
    headers={
        "Helicone-Property-Environment": "development", # simply add this header to your request
    }
)
```

### Best for: 

    - **Compare performance metrics** across different stages on Helicone's dashboard. Address any issues or performance bottlenecks before moving to production.
    - **Identify cost-saving opportunities** by tracking costs incurred at each stage, removing unnecessary expenses and optimizing resource usage. 
    - **Collect early user feedback** from staging environments and compare across stages to track improvements and refine your product.



## Use Case 2: User and Feature Segmentation 
    
Understanding user behavior patterns makes it easier to find opportunities to personalize marketing campaigns, introduce new features, or expand into new markets based on trends or demand patterns.  


### 1. Geographic Location

    Monitoring how your application perform across different geographic regions. 

    ```python 
        headers={
            "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
            "Helicone-Property-Country": "USA", # simply add this header to your request
        }
    ```

    **Best for**: 

    - Optimizing resource allocation
    - Refining pricing strategies
    - Targeting marketing efforts towards high-value user segments


### 2. Feature Segments 
    
    Monitoring feature performance or emerging trends among users. 

    ```python 
        headers={
            "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
            "Helicone-Property-Feature": "spellcheck", # simply add this header to your request
        }
    ```
    
    **Best for**: 
    
    - Smartly optimizing development efforts
    - Prioritizing features with proven demands
    - Aligning development priorities with user needs and pain points


### 3. Plan Segments 
    
    Implementing precise usage-based billing models by user types (free vs. premium). 

    ```python 
        headers={
            "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
            "Helicone-Property-Plan": "enterprise", # simply add this header to your request
        }
    ```
    
    **Best for:** 
    
    - Tracking user-specific metadata such as subscription plans, usage tiers, or subscription renewal dates
    - Identifying opportunities to upsell or cross-sell additional services
    - Tailoring subscription offerings to better align with customer preferences
