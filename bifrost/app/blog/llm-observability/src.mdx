**Building with LLMs in production (well) is incredibly difficult.** You probably have heard of the word *LLM Observability*. But what is it? How does it differ from traditional observability? What is being observed? We have the answers.

## The TL;DR

**LLM Observability is complete visibility** into every layer of an LLM-based software system - the application, the prompt, and the response. LLM Observability comes hand-in-hand with *LLM Monitoring*. While monitoring tracks application performance metrics, observability is **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>more investigative</span>**. 

|          | **LLM Observability** | **LLM Monitoring** |
| :------- |:------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**  | Event logging | Collect metrics |
| **Key Aspects** | Trace the flow of requests to understand system dependencies and interactions | Track application performance metrics, such as usage, cost, latency, error rates |
| **Example** | Correlate different types of data to understand issues and complex behaviours | Set up thresholds for unexpected behaviors |

## LLM vs. Traditional Observability - What's the Diff? 

**Traditional development is typically transactional**. Developers observe how the application handles HTTP requests/responses, a database query, or a published message. In contrast, **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>LLMs are much more complex</span>**. 

Here's a comparison of the logs: 

| Traditional | LLMs |
|:------------|:-----|
| Simple, isolated interactions | Indefinitely nested interactions, creating a complex tree structure |
| Clear start and end points | Encompass multiple interactions |
| Small body size (low KBs of data) | Massive payloads (potentially GBs) |
| Predictable behavior (easy to evaluate) | Lack of predictability (difficult to evaluate) | 
| Primarily text-based logs and numerical metrics | Multi-modal data (text, image, audio, video) |

## Issues with LLMs

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Hallucination</span>**: LLMs' objective is to predict the next few characters and not accuracy. This means that responses are not grounded in facts. 

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Complex use cases</span>**: LLM-based software systems require an increasing number of LLM calls to execute a complex task (i.e. agentic workflow). Reflexion is a technique engineers use to get LLMs to analyze their own results. But this consists of having multiple calls inside of multiple spans for checking hallucinations. 

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Proprietary data</span>**: Managing proprietary data is tricky. You need it to answer specific customer questions, but it can accidentally find its way into the responses.

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Quality of response</span>**: Is the response in the wrong tone? Is the amount of detail appropriate for your users' ask? 

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Cost (the big elephant in the room)</span>** - As usage goes up, and your LLM setup becomes more complicated (i.e. adding Reflexion), the cost can easily add up.

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Third-party models</span>**: Their API can change, new models and new guardrails can be added, causing your LLM app to behave differently than before.

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Limited competitive advantage</span>**: LLMs are hard to train and maintain. Chances are that you are using the same model as your competitor. Your differentiator becomes your prompt engineering and proprietary data.


## What LLM Observability Tools Have In Common

Developers working on LLM applications need effective tools to understand and address bugs, and exceptions, and prevent regressions. They require unique visibility into the functioning of these applications, including:

- Real-time monitoring of AI models
- Detailed error tracking and reporting
- Insights into user interactions and feedback
- Performance metrics and trend analysis
- Multi-metric correlations
- Tools for prompt iterations and experimentation
