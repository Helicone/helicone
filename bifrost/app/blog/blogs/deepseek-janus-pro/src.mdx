Shortly after the release of the groundbreaking DeepSeek R1 model, the DeepSeek team is back at it again with a new multimodal challenger. 

Their new **Deepseek Janus Pro** is a multimodal AI model designed for both text and image processing. It builds on the Deepseek Janus series by introducing better efficiency, enhanced generation capabilities, and a decoupled architecture for visual understanding and image creation.

This guide covers everything you need to know about Deepseek Janus Pro 7B, including an overview of its capabilities, comparisons with similar models, and a step-by-step **setup guide**. 

Let's explore what the game-changing DeepSeek team has to offer this time!

## What is DeepSeek Janus Pro?

Janus Pro is Deepseek’s latest unified multimodal model, designed to handle both text and image-based tasks efficiently. 

Unlike conventional models that separate language processing and image generation into different architectures, Janus Pro 7B adopts a decoupled visual encoding approach.

This allows it to excel in image understanding and text-to-image generation while maintaining high performance in text-based tasks.

## Janus Pro at a Glance
- **Model Type**: Unified multimodal understanding and generation model
- **Capabilities**:
  - Text generation
  - Image understanding
  - Text-to-image generation
- **Size Variants**: 1B and 7B parameters
- **Improvements over Janus**:
  - Expanded dataset
  - Enhanced text-to-image stability
  - Decoupled visual encoding for better performance
- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Outperforms DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium on benchmarks.
- **Availability**:
  - Open-source with a commercial use license (can be installed locally and commercialized)
  - Available on **Hugging Face**
- **Janus Pro Hardware Requirements/Specifications**:
    - 1B model: Consumer-grade GPU
    - 7B model: High-end GPU with sufficient VRAM (e.g NVIDIA A100) or Apple Silicon Mac with about 18GB of RAM 
    
## Comparison with Similar Models

Janus Pro 7B is positioned as a competitor to other multimodal models like OpenAI's DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Here's how it stacks up:

| Feature          | Janus Pro 7B | DALL-E 3 | Stable Diffusion 3 Medium |
|------------------|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Text Generation** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Image Understanding** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Text-to-Image Generation** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Decoupled Visual Encoding** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Open-Source** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Benchmark performance (GenEval)** | 80% | 67% | 74% |
| **Benchmark performance (DPG-bench)** | 84.19 | 83.50 | 84.08 |

### Key Takeaways:

- Janus Pro 7B is a **true multimodal model** that excels at both image understanding and text generation.
- It outperforms both DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium on GenEval (which tests **text-to-image generation** capabilities) and DPG (which tests a model’s ability to follow **complex image generation prompts**) benchmarks.

## Janus Pro 7B Architecture

Janus Pro 7B separates visual encoding from generation, improving both performance and flexibility. 

Unlike traditional unified models that share a single visual encoder for both understanding and generation, Janus Pro 7B decouples these processes. This eliminates conflicts that typically degrade image generation quality.

The model integrates rectified flow techniques for stable text-to-image conversion while maintaining autoregressive processing for textual tasks. This combination—dubbed <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janusflow</a>—results in more coherent text outputs and higher-quality image generations.

## How to Use Janus Pro 7B

If you’re looking to use Deepseek Janus Pro 7B, you have two options: using the **Hugging Face demo**, or running it **locally**.

### 1. Running Janus Pro 7B on Hugging Face

Hugging Face provides an online demo, allowing you to use <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepseek-ai/Janus-Pro-7B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janus Pro 7B online</a> without any setup via Hugging Face Spaces.

### 2. Installing Janus Pro 7B Locally

To run the model locally, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus.git
cd Janus
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** and **pip** installed. Then run:

```sh
pip install -e .[gradio]
```

#### Step 3: Run the Gradio Demo Locally

```sh
