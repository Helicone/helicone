## What is DeepSeek Janus Pro?

Janus Pro is DeepSeek’s latest unified multimodal model, designed to handle both text and image-based tasks efficiently.

Unlike conventional models that separate language processing and image generation into different architectures, Janus Pro 7B adopts a decoupled visual encoding approach. This allows it to excel in image understanding and text-to-image generation while maintaining high performance in text-based tasks.

## Comparison with Similar Models

Janus Pro 7B is positioned as a competitor to other multimodal models like OpenAI's DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, and <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gemini-2.0-flash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a>.

Here's how it stacks up:

| Feature                               | Janus Pro 7B | DALL-E 3 | Stable Diffusion 3 Medium |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------- |

| **Image Understanding**               | ✅           | ✅       | ✅                        |
| **Text-to-Image Generation**          | ✅           | ✅       | ✅                        |
| **Decoupled Visual Encoding**         | ✅           | ❌       | ❌                        |
| **Open-Source**                       | ✅           | ❌       | ✅                        |
| **Benchmark performance (GenEval)**   | 80%          | 67%      | 74%                       |
| **Benchmark performance (DPG-bench)** | 84.19        | 83.50    | 84.08                     |

### TL;DR

- Janus Pro 7B is a **true multimodal model** that excels at both image understanding and text generation.
- It outperforms both DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium on GenEval (which tests **text-to-image generation** capabilities) and DPG (which tests a model’s ability to follow **complex image generation prompts**) benchmarks.

## Janus Pro 7B Architecture

Janus Pro 7B separates visual encoding from generation, improving both performance and flexibility.

Unlike traditional unified models that share a single visual encoder for both understanding and generation, Janus Pro 7B decouples these processes. This eliminates conflicts that typically degrade image generation quality.

The model integrates rectified flow techniques for stable text-to-image conversion while maintaining autoregressive processing for textual tasks. This combination—dubbed <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2411.07975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janusflow</a>—results in more coherent text outputs and higher-quality image generations.
