### Ollama UI vs Open WebUI

Ollama UI is primarily geared for use with Ollama and is designed for simplicity. But it's limited to that ecosystem and lacks the advanced features, integrations, and flexibility that make Open WebUI better suited for power users and custom workflows.

### Getting Started with Ollama UI

Follow these steps to set up Ollama UI on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ollama-ui/ollama-ui
cd ollama-ui
make

open http://localhost:8000  # Open in your browser
```

You can also use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ollama-ui/cmgdpmlhgjhoadnonobjeekmfcehffco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome Extension</a> for a hassle-free experience.

Once installed, you can start chatting with your Ollama models right from your browser.

## Bottom Line

While Open WebUI is a solid choice for running local LLMs, there are plenty of alternatives that offer different strengths. Whether you need an easy-to-configure tool like Chatbox, a full-featured UI like Text Generation WebUI, or a Hugging Face-integrated solution like HuggingChat, there's an option that will fit your needs.

We recommend exploring these alternatives to find the best match for your workflow and computing environment.

      answer: "Looking at Open WebUI vs Chatbox shows that Chatbox supports multiple models and is available across more platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and is a more user-friendly but less customizable Open WebUI alternative. Chatbox also requires a subscription for certain features."

    {
      question: "Is Stable Diffusion WebUI a good Open WebUI alternative?",
      answer: "No. Stable Diffusion WebUI is meant for image‚Äînot text‚Äîmodels. The mentioned Open-WebUI alternatives focus on text-based LLMs rather than image generation. Though some of the options listed, including Open WebUI, support image models, they're specifically designed for interacting with language models."
