## Acting as a Gateway

The biggest difference between LangSmith and Helicone is how we log your data. Helicone is Gateway whereas LangSmith is an async solution. To integrate with Helicone, it’s as easy as changing the base URL to point to Helicone, and we’ll handle every call you make. As a cherry on top, Helicone exists to fit into any existing tech stack. A minor difference is that LangSmith tracks logs per trace, Helicone tracks logs per request and can support extremely large request bodies.
