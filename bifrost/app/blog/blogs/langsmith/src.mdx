Both Helicone and LangSmith are very capable observability platforms used by enterprises and startups to develop, deploy and monitor LLM applications.

These tools are essential for gaining full visibility into how well your LLM apps are performing and optimizing them. 

**But, which is better for you?**

![Helicone vs. LangSmith, which is better?](/static/blog/langsmith-vs-helicone/cover-image.webp)

Let's compare them to help you decide.

## What Makes Helicone Different?

Helicone offers some distinctive advantages over similar LLM observability tools:

### 1. Dual Integration Approach

Helicone provides flexibility with two integration methods:

- **Proxy integration**: Route requests through Helicone by changing a single URL
- **Async logging**: Capture LLM usage asynchronously without affecting application performance

*LangSmith, on the other hand, uses only an async SDK-based approach that requires more code changes and wrapping functions with decorators.*

### 2. Great Accessibility

Helicone's dashboard is designed so both developers and non-technical team members can understand what's happening:

- See costs and usage at a glance
- Filter and group data easily without writing queries
- Experiment with prompts through a simple interface
- Track real user sessions visually

### 3. Minimal Latency Impact & Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Even when functioning as a proxy, Helicone minimizes performance impact and is built to be reliable enough for mission-critical applications: 

- Edge deployment using Cloudflare Workers for global low-latency
- Only adds approximately 50ms to request times for 95% of global users
- 99.9999% typical uptime

### Dashboard Comparison: Helicone vs LangSmith

#### Helicone's dashboard: Simple yet Powerful

![Helicone Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langfuse-alternatives/helicone-dashboard.webp)

Helicone gives you a clean, intuitive view of your LLM usage:

- See costs broken down by model, feature, and user
- Track how many tokens you're using and how much you're spending
- Measure response times and identify slowdowns
- Find and fix errors quickly with categorized error tracking
- View usage patterns across different regions

What's great is that you don't need to be a data analyst to understand the dashboard. It's designed for everyone on your team, technical or not.

#### LangSmith's dashboard: Technical and Robust

![LangSmith Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langsmith-vs-helicone/Langsmith-dashboard.png)

LangSmith organizes everything into:

- **Runs**: Individual operations (like a single LLM call)
- **Threads**: Groups of related operations that fulfill a user request
- **Projects**: Collections of traces for different parts of your application

The interface is more technical than Helicone's but provides somewhat deeper visibility into complex workflows.

## Helicone: Simple but Powerful Observability

Helicone focuses on making LLM monitoring as painless as possible while still giving you powerful features.

### Key Capabilities

- **Simple setup**: Change one URL and you're logging everything
- **Cost efficiency**: Manage costs with features like caching and detailed cost tracking 
- **Custom data tracking**: Add your own metadata to requests for better analysis
- **Sessions**: See complete user journeys across multiple requests, great for building agentic workflows
- **Security tools**: Robust built-in security features to protect your apps against attacks like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prompt injection</a>
- **Feedback collection**: Gather user feedback on AI responses
- **Evaluation & prompt management**: Keep track of prompt versions and changes, perform prompt evaluations and experiments to find the best prompts

### Integration Example

Helicone's proxy integration requires minimal code changes:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: { "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}` }
});
```

## LangSmith: Deep Workflow Analysis

LangSmith specializes in tracing complex AI workflows, particularly those built with LangChain (built by the same team). It breaks down each step of your application to help you understand exactly what's happening.

### Key Capabilities

- **Detailed workflow tracing**: See every step your LLMs take
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Test your AI outputs against various metrics and criteria
- **Seamless LangChain integration**: Perfect if you're already in the LangChain ecosystem
- **Structured prompt management**: Keep track of prompt versions and changes
- **Feedback collection**: Gather user feedback on AI responses

### Integration Approach

LangSmith uses an async SDK-based approach. This involves using function decorators to trace your code. For example:

```python
from langsmith import traceable

@traceable
def process_query(question):
    # Application logic
    return response
```

This method requires more code changes and technical but gives you detailed insights into each function.

<FAQ 
  items={[
    {
      question: "How hard is it to add these tools to my existing app?",
      answer: "Helicone can be added by changing a single line of code (for the proxy approach) or using their SDK for background async logging. LangSmith requires adding decorators to your functions and using their SDK throughout your code."
    },
    {
      question: "Will these tools help me save money on my LLM costs?",
      answer: "Helicone has built-in caching that can significantly reduce costs by reusing responses for similar requests. LangSmith doesn't have any features particularly geared towards cost saving besides basic cost tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I host these tools on my own servers?",
      answer: "Yes, both offer self-hosting. Helicone gives you more options (manual setup, Kubernetes, Docker, cloud deployment) and can be hosted for free, while LangSmith focuses on Kubernetes and Docker and requires an Enterprise subscription."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be a developer to understand the dashboards?",
      answer: "Helicone's dashboard is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users. LangSmith has a more technical focus and assumes some development knowledge."
    },
    {
      question: "Which one has better security?",
      answer: "Helicone offers more security features, including key management, rate limiting, and protection against prompt injection attacks. LangSmith provides basic security controls like access management."
    },
    {
      question: "Can these tools handle high traffic?",
      answer: "Helicone is built on a highly distributed cloud infrastructure designed for massive scale. LangSmith is more centralized, however, and may face challenges with extremely high volumes."
    },
    {
      question: "Do they work with all LLM providers?",
      answer: "Helicone works with virtually all LLM providers, while LangSmith supports a more limited number of providers but works better within the LangChain ecosystem."
