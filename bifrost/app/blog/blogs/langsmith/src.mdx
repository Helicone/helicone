Both Helicone and LangSmith are capable, powerful DevOps platforms used by enterprises and developers to develop, deploy, and monitor their LLM applications and gain full visibility into their development. 

**But which platform is better for production?** Let's compare.

![Helicone vs. LangSmith, which is better?](/static/blog/langsmith-vs-helicone/cover-image.webp)

## What Makes Helicone Different?

### 1. Helicone is Open-Source

Helicone is fully <a href="https://github.com/helicone/helicone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source</a> and free to start. Companies can also <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/self-host/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-host</a> Helicone within their infrastructure. This ensures that you have full control over the application, flexibility, and customization tailored to specific business needs.

### 2. Ease of Integration

Developers often choose Helicone for our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/openai/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple proxy setup</a>. Simply by changing the base URL, you can start logging everything with any providers.

```python
https://oai.helicone.ai/v1 # new baseURL
https://api.openai.com/v1 # old baseURL
```

Being a proxy, Helicone offers caching, prompt threat detection, key vault, rate limiting, and other useful gateway features. 

However, if you don't want to place Helicone in your critical path, you can use our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/openllmetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**async logging**</a> method. 

<BottomLine
  title="Latency Impact & Reliability üí°"
  description="Helicone is built on the edge using Cloudflare Workers to minimize time to response. This adds only ~50 ms for about 95% of the world's Internet-connected population. We're also proud of our 99.99% uptime in the last year."
/>

### 3. Scalable Usage-Based Pricing

Helicone is more cost-effective than LangSmith for two reasons. 

First, we operate on a **volumetric pricing model** that gets cheaper the more requests you have. Second, our paid tier starts at  <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20/seat/month</a>, which gets you access to all features in Helicone, compared to $39/seat/month for LangSmith. Our seat-based pricing caps at **$200/mo** for fast-growing teams needing unlimited seats. 

**Here's how the pricing scales between Helicone and LangSmith:**

## UI Comparison: Helicone vs LangSmith

{/* ### Helicone: Simple but Powerful Observability */}

![Helicone Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langfuse-alternatives/helicone-dashboard.webp)

We believe that observability should be simple and intuitive at Helicone, that's why we designed our platform to be easy to use and understand.
It's reflected in both our UI and workflow that are designed to make you more productive as a developer.

What's great is that you don't need to be a data analyst to understand the dashboard. It's designed for a wide range of technical experiences.

### Integration Example

Helicone's proxy integration requires minimal code changes. Here's an example of integration with <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/openai/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a>:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: { "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}` }
});
```

See docs for <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/anthropic/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/gemini/api/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> and more.

### LangSmith Dashboard

![LangSmith Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langsmith-vs-helicone/Langsmith-dashboard.png)

LangSmith specializes in tracing complex AI workflows, particularly those built with LangChain (built by the same team). LangSmith organizes everything into:

- **Runs**: Individual operations (like a single LLM call)
- **Threads**: Groups of related operations that fulfill a user request
- **Projects**: Collections of traces for different parts of your application

LangSmith's interface is more technical than Helicone's but provides somewhat deeper visibility into complex workflows. 

<BottomLine
  title="üí° Please note:"
  description="LangSmith's dashboard is customizable if you want to build your own analytics from scratch. If you want a pre-built dashboard with the most important LLM metrics, Helicone might be a better choice for you."
/>

### Integration Approach

LangSmith uses an async SDK-based approach. This involves using function decorators to trace your code. For example:

```python
from langsmith import traceable

@traceable
def process_query(question):
    # Application logic
    return response
```

This method requires more code changes and is more technical but gives you detailed insights into each function.

## Which platform should you choose?

We hear our customers say that their experience of monitoring LLM application in Helicone is intuitive and integrates well into any LLM observability tech stack. LangSmith is a great tool, and there are some things we would recommend them over Helicone for, such as if you're an enterprise that is in the LangChain ecosystem.

We've distilled the key features of Helicone and LangSmith into a table to help you decide which platform is best for your needs: 

| **Choose Helicone if you need:**                                                                                  | **Choose LangSmith if you need:**                                                                                  |

| üîπ A tool your entire team can easily use  (technical and non-technical)                                             | ‚¨• A Python-first, developer-heavy workflow                                                                         |
| üîπ Support for multiple LLM providers                                                                             | ‚¨• Comfort with a closed-source solution                                                                            |

<FAQ 
  items={[
    {
      question: "How hard is it to add Helicone or LangSmith to my existing app?",
      answer: "Helicone can be added by changing a single line of code (for the proxy approach) or using their SDK for background async logging. LangSmith requires adding decorators to your functions and using their SDK throughout your code."
    },
    {
      question: "Will these tools help me save money on my LLM costs?",
      answer: "Helicone has built-in caching that can significantly reduce costs by reusing responses for similar requests. LangSmith doesn't have any features particularly geared towards cost saving besides basic cost tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I host these tools on my own servers?",
      answer: "Yes, both offer self-hosting. Helicone gives you more options (manual setup, Kubernetes, Docker, cloud deployment) and can be hosted for free, while LangSmith focuses on Kubernetes and Docker and requires an Enterprise subscription."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be a developer to understand the dashboards?",
      answer: "Helicone's dashboard is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users. LangSmith has a more technical focus and assumes some development knowledge."
    },
    {
      question: "Which one has better security?",
      answer: "Helicone offers more security features, including key management, rate limiting, and protection against prompt injection attacks. LangSmith provides basic security controls like access management."
    },
    {
      question: "Can these tools handle high traffic?",
      answer: "Helicone is built on a highly distributed cloud infrastructure designed for massive scale. LangSmith is more centralized, however, and may face challenges with extremely high volumes."
    },
    {
      question: "Do they work with all LLM providers?",
      answer: "Helicone works with virtually all LLM providers, while LangSmith supports a more limited number of providers but works better within the LangChain ecosystem."
