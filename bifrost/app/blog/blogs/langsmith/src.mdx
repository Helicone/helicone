Both Helicone and LangSmith are capable, powerful DevOps platforms used by enterprises and developers to develop, deploy, and monitor their LLM applications and gain full visibility into their development. 

**But which platform is better?** Let's compare.

![Helicone vs. LangSmith, which is better?](/static/blog/langsmith-vs-helicone/cover-image.webp)

## What Makes Helicone Different?

### 1. Helicone is Open-Source

Helicone is fully <a href="https://github.com/helicone/helicone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source</a> and free to start. Companies can also <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/self-host/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-host</a> Helicone within their infrastructure. This ensures that you have full control over the application, flexibility, and customization tailored to specific business needs.

### 2. Ease of Integration

Developers often choose Helicone for our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/openai/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple proxy setup</a>. Simply by changing the base URL, you can start logging everything with any providers.

```python
https://oai.helicone.ai/v1 # new baseURL
https://api.openai.com/v1 # old baseURL
```

Being a proxy, Helicone offers caching, prompt threat detection, key vault, rate limiting, and other useful gateway features. 

However, if you don't want to place Helicone in your critical path, you can use our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/openllmetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**async logging**</a> method. 

### 3. Minimal Latency Impact & Enterprise-Grade Reliability

When making the critical decision to build Helicone as a proxy, we made sure it minimizes latency impact and is built to be reliable enough for mission-critical applications. 

We deploy on the edge using Cloudflare Workers to minimize time to response. This adds only <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">~50 ms </a>for about 95% of the world's Internet-connected population. We're also proud of our **99.99% uptime** in the last year.

## UI Comparison: Helicone vs LangSmith

{/* ### Helicone: Simple but Powerful Observability */}

![Helicone Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langfuse-alternatives/helicone-dashboard.webp)

We believe that observability should be simple and intuitive, that's why we designed our platform to be easy to use and understand.
It's reflected in both our UI and workflow that are designed to make you more productive as a developer.

What's great is that you don't need to be a data analyst to understand the dashboard. It's designed for everyone on your team, technical or not.

### Integration Example

Helicone's proxy integration requires minimal code changes. Here's an example of integration with <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/openai/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a>:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: { "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}` }
});
```

![LangSmith Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langsmith-vs-helicone/Langsmith-dashboard.png)

LangSmith specializes in tracing complex AI workflows, particularly those built with LangChain (built by the same team). LangSmith organizes everything into:

- **Runs**: Individual operations (like a single LLM call)
- **Threads**: Groups of related operations that fulfill a user request
- **Projects**: Collections of traces for different parts of your application

The interface is more technical than Helicone's but provides somewhat deeper visibility into complex workflows.

### Integration Approach

LangSmith uses an async SDK-based approach. This involves using function decorators to trace your code. For example:

```python
from langsmith import traceable

@traceable
def process_query(question):
    # Application logic
    return response
```

This method requires more code changes and is more technical but gives you detailed insights into each function.

## Which platform should you choose?

With Helicone, the experience of observing and monitoring your LLM is intuitive and integrates well into any LLM observability tech stack. LangSmith is a great tool, and there are some things we would recommend them over Helicone for, such as if you're an enterprise that uses LangChain, develops AI agents, or prefers async solutions.

We've distilled the key features of Helicone and LangSmith into a table to help you decide which platform is best for your needs:

<FAQ 
  items={[
    {
      question: "How hard is it to add Helicone or LangSmith to my existing app?",
      answer: "Helicone can be added by changing a single line of code (for the proxy approach) or using their SDK for background async logging. LangSmith requires adding decorators to your functions and using their SDK throughout your code."
    },
    {
      question: "Will these tools help me save money on my LLM costs?",
      answer: "Helicone has built-in caching that can significantly reduce costs by reusing responses for similar requests. LangSmith doesn't have any features particularly geared towards cost saving besides basic cost tracking."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I host these tools on my own servers?",
      answer: "Yes, both offer self-hosting. Helicone gives you more options (manual setup, Kubernetes, Docker, cloud deployment) and can be hosted for free, while LangSmith focuses on Kubernetes and Docker and requires an Enterprise subscription."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be a developer to understand the dashboards?",
      answer: "Helicone's dashboard is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users. LangSmith has a more technical focus and assumes some development knowledge."
    },
    {
      question: "Which one has better security?",
      answer: "Helicone offers more security features, including key management, rate limiting, and protection against prompt injection attacks. LangSmith provides basic security controls like access management."
    },
    {
      question: "Can these tools handle high traffic?",
      answer: "Helicone is built on a highly distributed cloud infrastructure designed for massive scale. LangSmith is more centralized, however, and may face challenges with extremely high volumes."
    },
    {
      question: "Do they work with all LLM providers?",
      answer: "Helicone works with virtually all LLM providers, while LangSmith supports a more limited number of providers but works better within the LangChain ecosystem."
