## Components to improve LLM prompts

### Data collection

You need high-quality input variables to create high-quality prompts. A common practice is to use “**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>golden datasets</span>**” - data that’s meticulously cleaned and labeled - to tune your prompt for problems that are easily reproducible.

Teams like QA Wolf use a new approach by **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>randomly sampling production data</span>**, which represents actual user interactions and offers a more accurate representation of real-world use cases. QA Wolf leverages Helicone to monitor their agents and run systematic experiments, iteratively refining them to achieve 100% accuracy.

### Prompt management

Think of it like Git for prompts. Prompt registries are specialized tools to help engineers **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>version, manage or improve prompts</span>**, and roll back to a previous version easily.

### Prompt playgrounds

Playgrounds are **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>interactive environments</span>** that helps engineers iteratively test and refine their prompts. Notably, playgrounds enable rapid prompt iteration, testing against real-world data, and fine-tuning of model parameters and metadata configurations like `top_k`.

### Evaluators & scores

Feedback is essential for continuous improvement. The best tools analyze LLM outputs by assigning **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>qualitative and quantitative scores</span>** such as tone alignment and Semantic Similarity. They make it easy to compare different prompt variations and help engineers justify prompt changes with data before pushing to production

_Steps to test your prompt: log > evaluate > experiment > deploy_

## Preparation

### **Step 1: Log your LLM requests**

Use an observability tool to log your LLM requests and track key metrics like usage, latency, cost, time-to-first-token (TTFT). These tools provide dashboards to help you monitor irregularity, such as:

- Rising error rates
- Sudden spikes in API costs.
- Declining user satisfaction scores.

This data helps you identify when it’s time to improve your prompt.

## Testing Process

### Step 2: Create prompt variations

Experiment with prompt versions using <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-shot prompting</a>. Testing environments like _Helicone_ makes it easier to track prompt versions, inputs, and outputs, while also providing rollback capabilities if changes lead to underperformance/regression.

<BottomLine
  title="💡 Pro Tip"
  description="You can create as many prompt variations as you need, where each tests one variable at a time (i.e. phrasing, model parameters) to isolate its impact."
/>

### Step 3: Use real data to generate outputs

Run your prompts on real-world datasets to ensure they can handle variability and edge cases. There are 2 options:

- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Golden datasets</span>** with curated inputs with known expected outputs.
- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Randomly sampled production data</span>** which is more representative of real-world scenarios (Here's <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-evaluation-for-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why this approach is better</a>).

### Step 4: Compare outputs

Evaluate the performance of your prompts using the best methods that suits your goals and capacity, such as:

- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Real user feedback</span>** for subjective insights.
- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Human evaluators</span>** for nuanced assessments.
- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>LLM-as-a-judge</span>** for scalable and efficient comparisons.

### Step 5: Push the best prompt to production

Once you've identified the best-performing prompt, deploy it to production. Remember to continue to monitor your application using observability tools to track metrics and identify opportunities for further refinement.

# How to evaluate prompts before and after deployment

Evaluating prompts is about assessing how effectively your inputs—such as prompts and context—generate the desired outputs. Unlike generic model benchmarks, evaluations are tailored to your specific use case, providing targeted insights into performance.

## Key evaluation methods

![Add preset or custom evaluators to score your LLM outputs](/static/blog/test-your-llm-prompts/evaluator.webp)

_Add preset or custom evaluators to score your LLM outputs._

### 1. Real user feedback

Collect feedback directly from users to gauge how well your LLM performs in real-world scenarios. This can be done through feature implementation to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>solicit explicit feedback</span>**, such as thumbs up/down rating or scoring outputs, or by **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>analyzing implicit user behaviors</span>**, like time spent engaging with responses or completion rates.

**Bottom Line**

Getting user feedback is very useful for understanding practical challenges, but it can be time-consuming and subjective. However, only when your users use your product over time, will you start receiving feedback to improve upon.

How can we evaluate prompts before deployment? Let’s look at some alternative evaluation methods.

### 2. Human evaluators

Use human reviewers to assess output quality based on specific criteria like relevance, tone, or correctness. This method usually begins with building a test dataset that human evaluators will compare the output against.

Based on the output, evaluators will score the response with `yes/no`, `0-10` (**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>direct scoring</span>**) or is given a set of LLM responses where the evaluator will pick the better response (**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>A/B testing or pairwise comparisons</span>**).

**Bottom Line**

Human evaluation is highly reliable for nuanced situations but is resource-intensive because the ground truth has to be constructed beforehand. It can also be subjective, leading to misinformation and much harder to scale.

### 3. LLM-as-a-judge

An alternative to human evaluation is using an LLM with an **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>evaluation prompt</span>** to rate the generated outputs based on a criteria, especially for tasks like chatbot responses or complex text generation. This methods works well for both **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>offline and online evaluations</span>**.

<BottomLine
  title="💡 What is online or offline evaluation?"
  description="Online evaluation uses live data and user interactions to capture real-world scenarios, while offline evaluation tests in controlled environments with past or synthetic data for safe, reproducible pre-deployment assessment. "
/>

#### Deterministic testing

LLM-as-a-judge is useful for scenarios where outputs are predictable and well-defined, such as:

- Classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis - positive or negative).
- Structured outputs (e.g., JSON validation).
- Constraint checks (e.g., ensuring no profanity or meet specific formatting rules).

#### Tips for success

- Test the evaluation prompt itself: make sure the prompt is clear and accurate.
- Use few-shot learning: Include good and bad examples to help guide the evaluation.
- Temperature setting: Set the evaluation LLM’s temperature to 0 to ensure consistent answers from LLMs.

**Bottom Line**

This approach can **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>approximate human judgment</span>** while being more scalable and efficient. But keep in mind that LLM-assisted evaluations can inherit biases from training data, and may or may not outperform human evaluations. Creating an effective evaluation prompt is critical for this method to see reliable results.

## Why evaluating prompts is important (and difficult)

To optimize your LLM application, you need a way to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>quantify its performance</span>**. Choosing the right evaluation method is just as important as the evaluation itself because different evaluators are better suited for certain use cases. For example:

An LLM chatbot designed for **technical support** will need metrics like:

1. Whether the response directly addresses the specific issue raised by the customer.
2. Whether the response avoids contradictory information or irrelevant "fluff."
3. Whether the tone is appropriate (e.g., helpful and professional).

An LLM handles **creative tasks** (i.e. stories or marketing copy) will need metrics like:

4. Whether the response is original, interesting and concise.
5. Whether the response is aligned with brand guidelines or follow the desired tone.
6. Whether the response adhere to structural requirements (e.g., word count, formatting).

### Choosing the right metrics

At the end of the day, the choice of evaluation metrics depends on your application’s goals. For example, **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>faithfulness</span>** is ideal for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications to measure how well the AI response adheres to the provide context, while metrics like **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>BLEU</span>** or **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>ROUGE</span>** are better for translation-specific tasks and text-summarization tasks respectively.

## Real-world examples

To evaluate LLM outputs effectively, start by identifying the specific aspect of the response you want to assess:

- **Accuracy:** Does the response answer the question or solve the task?
- **Fluency:** Is the response grammatically correct and natural-sounding?
- **Relevance:** Does the response stay on topic and meet the user's intent?
- **Creativity:** Is the response imaginative or engaging?
- **Consistency:** Does it match prior outputs or user inputs?

### **a) Measuring accuracy**

**Example:**

A chatbot answering a factual query “What is the population of France?”

**Recommendations:**

- Reference scoring: Compare the output to a predefined ground truth for correctness.
- Human evaluation: Use for nuanced questions or when ground truth is unavailable.
- Word-level metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE): Measure token overlap between generated and reference outputs for precise tasks.

### **b) Comparing two prompt versions**

**Example:**

Testing whether an updated summarization prompt performs better than the previous version.

**Recommendations:**

- A/B testing: Put outputs side-by-side for human evaluators or users to pick the better one.
- LLM-as-a-judge: Automate A/B testing by using a carefully-designed evaluation prompt.

### **c) Evaluating edge cases or critical outputs**

**Example:**

Assessing a medical assistant recommending treatment options.

**Recommendations:**

- Human evaluation: Involve domain experts to ensure safety, reliability, and compliance.
- Reference scoring: Use authoritative sources to build a dataset as benchmarks.
- A/B testing: Experiment with a modified prompt or tweak model parameters to improve accuracy.

### **d) Measuring usability**

**Example:**

A virtual assistant handling user queries in a help desk scenario.

**Recommendations:**

- Real user feedback: Analyze explicit ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down) and implicit behaviors (e.g., engagement time or rejection rates).
- Human evaluation: Pre-deployment tests for adherence to tone, accuracy, and helpfulness.

### **e) Assessing creative outputs**

**Example:**

Generating a poetry or brainstorming a story idea.

**Recommendations:**

- Scoring: Use human evaluators to rate outputs on creativity, coherence, and adherence to style guidelines.
- Human evaluation: Crucial for subjective tasks where creativity and engagement matter most.
- LLM-as-a-judge: Automate creative evaluations using fine-tuned models if cost or scalability is a concern.
