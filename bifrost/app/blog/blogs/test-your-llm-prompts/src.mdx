While competitors rely on synthetic datasets or manually created examples, Helicone lets you test prompt variations against actual user queries from your application.

{/* ## Components to improve LLM prompts

### Data collection

You need high-quality input variables to create high-quality prompts. A common practice is to use "**golden datasets**" - data that's meticulously cleaned and labeled - to tune your prompt for problems that are easily reproducible.

Teams like QA Wolf use a new approach by <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-evaluation-for-llms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">randomly sampling production data</a>, which represents actual user interactions and offers a more accurate representation of real-world use cases. QA Wolf leverages Helicone to monitor their agents and run systematic experiments, iteratively refining them to achieve 100% accuracy.

### Prompt management

Think of it like Git for prompts. <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prompt management</a> tools are specialized tools to help engineers **version, manage or improve prompts**, and roll back to a previous version easily.

### Prompt playgrounds

Playgrounds are **interactive environments** that helps engineers iteratively test and refine their prompts. Notably, playgrounds enable rapid prompt iteration, testing against real-world data, and fine-tuning of model parameters and metadata configurations like `top_k`.

### Evaluators & scores

Feedback is essential for continuous improvement. The best tools analyze LLM outputs by assigning **qualitative and quantitative scores** such as tone alignment and Semantic Similarity. They make it easy to compare different prompt variations and help engineers justify prompt changes with data before pushing to production */}

## Step-by-Step Guide to Systematically Test Your LLM Prompts

Properly testing your prompts involves setting up a systematic workflow that iteratively improves performance. This process ensures you're equipped to handle dynamic scenarios, minimize errors, and optimize user experience.

![Prompt Evaluation Lifecycle in Helicone](/static/blog/test-your-llm-prompts/prompt-evaluation-lifecycle.webp)
_Steps to test your prompt: log > experiment > evaluate > deploy_

### Step 1: Log your LLM requests

Use an <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/best-langsmith-alternatives" rel="noopener" target="_blank">observability tool</a> like Helicone to log your LLM requests and track key metrics like usage, latency, cost, time-to-first-token (TTFT). These tools provide dashboards to help you monitor irregularities, such as:

- Rising error rates
- Sudden spikes in API costs
- Declining user satisfaction scores

This data can help you identify when it might be time to improve your prompt.

### Step 2: Create prompt variations (aka. experiments)

Experiment with <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prompt engineering techniques</a> like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/chain-of-thought-prompting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chain-of-thought (CoT)</a> and multi-shot prompting. Testing environments like Helicone's <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/prompts/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt Editor</a> help track versions, inputs, and outputs while providing rollback capabilities.

<BottomLine
  title="💡 Pro Tip"
  description="In Helicone's Experiment feature, you can create as many prompt variations as you need. For example, developers often test the same prompt between different models, or different parameters to figure out the best performing combination."
/>

### Step 3: Run prompt variations on production data

Run your prompts on actual user requests collected in Helicone to ensure they can handle variability and edge cases. 

Developers often test prompts on these datasets:

- **Golden datasets:** Curated inputs with known expected outputs.
- **Samples of production data:** More representative of real-world scenarios. <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-evaluation-for-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's why this approach is better</a>. 

Once you get the outputs, compare and evaluate to find the best-performing prompt. You can use evaluation methods like: 

- **LLM-as-a-judge:** This is where an LLM acts as an evaluator; it's more scalable and efficient.
- **Actual user feedback:** It's a great way to get qualitative insights. However, it can be subjective and time-consuming.
- **Human evaluators:** These manually score the outputs and can provide more nuanced assessments.

### Step 4: Push your best prompt to production and monitor it

Once you've identified the best-performing prompt(s), deploy it to production. 

Remember to monitor your application using trusted observability tools to track usage and user feedback. They are also super helpful to identify opportunities for further improvements.

{/* ## How to evaluate prompts before and after deployment

Evaluating prompts is about assessing how effectively your inputs—such as prompts and context—generate the desired outputs. Unlike generic model benchmarks, evaluations are tailored to your specific use case, providing targeted insights into performance.

### Key evaluation methods

![Add preset or custom evaluators to score your LLM outputs](/static/blog/test-your-llm-prompts/evaluator.webp)

_Add preset or custom evaluators to score your LLM outputs._

### 1. Real user feedback

Collect feedback directly from users to gauge how well your LLM performs in real-world scenarios. This can be done through feature implementation to <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> solicit explicit feedback</a> or by analyzing implicit user behaviors, like time spent engaging with responses or completion rates.

**Bottom Line**

Getting user feedback is very useful for understanding practical challenges, but can be time-consuming and subjective. However, only when your users use your product over time, will you start receiving feedback to improve upon.

How can we evaluate prompts before deployment? Let's look at some alternative evaluation methods.

### 2. Human evaluators

Use human reviewers to assess output quality based on specific criteria like relevance, tone, or correctness. This method usually begins with building a test dataset that human evaluators will compare the output against.

Based on the output, evaluators will score the response with `yes/no`, `0-10` (<a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/scores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct scoring</a>) or is given a set of LLM responses where the evaluator will pick the better response (A/B testing or pairwise comparisons).

**Bottom Line**

Human evaluation is highly reliable for nuanced situations but is resource-intensive because the ground truth has to be constructed beforehand. It can also be subjective, leading to misinformation and much harder to scale.

### 3. LLM-as-a-judge

An alternative to human evaluation is using an LLM with an **evaluation prompt** to rate the generated outputs based on a criteria, especially for tasks like chatbot responses or complex text generation. This methods works well for both **offline and online evaluations**.

<BottomLine
  title="💡 What is online or offline evaluation?"
  description="Online evaluation uses live data and user interactions to capture real-world scenarios, while offline evaluation tests in controlled environments with past or synthetic data for safe, reproducible pre-deployment assessment. "
/>

### Deterministic testing

LLM-as-a-judge is useful for scenarios where outputs are predictable and well-defined, such as:

- Classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis - positive or negative).
- Structured outputs (e.g., JSON validation).
- Constraint checks (e.g., ensuring no profanity or meet specific formatting rules).

### Tips for success

- Test the evaluation prompt itself: make sure the prompt is clear and accurate.
- Use few-shot learning: Include good and bad examples to help guide the evaluation.
- Temperature setting: Set the evaluation LLM's temperature to 0 to ensure consistent answers from LLMs.

**Bottom Line**

This approach can approximate human judgment while being more scalable and efficient. But keep in mind that LLM-assisted evaluations can inherit biases from training data, and may or may not outperform human evaluations. Creating an effective evaluation prompt is critical for this method to see reliable results. */}

{/* ## Why evaluating prompts is important (and difficult)

To optimize your LLM application, you need a way to quantify its performance. Choosing the right evaluation method is just as important as the evaluation itself because different evaluators are better suited for certain use cases. For example:

An LLM chatbot designed for **technical support** will need metrics like:

1. Whether the response directly addresses the specific issue raised by the customer.
2. Whether the response avoids contradictory information or irrelevant "fluff."
3. Whether the tone is appropriate (e.g., helpful and professional).

An LLM handles **creative tasks** (i.e. stories or marketing copy) will need metrics like:

4. Whether the response is original, interesting and concise.
5. Whether the response is aligned with brand guidelines or follow the desired tone.
6. Whether the response adhere to structural requirements (e.g., word count, formatting). */}

## Choosing the Right Metrics

When experimenting and evaluating prompts, your choice of evaluation metrics must align with your goals. 

For example: 

- **Faithfulness:** Ideal for RAG applications to measure how well responses adhere to provided context
- **BLEU/ROUGE:** Best for translation and text summarization tasks
- **Relevance:** Measures how well responses address the specific query
- **Coherence:** Evaluates logical flow and readability of responses
- **Toxicity:** Tests for harmful, unsafe, or offensive content
- **Custom metrics:** For specialized or domain-specific applications

## Real-world examples

To evaluate LLM outputs effectively, start by identifying the specific aspect of the response you want to assess:

- **Accuracy:** Does the response answer the question or solve the task?
- **Fluency:** Is the response grammatically correct and natural-sounding?
- **Relevance:** Does the response stay on topic and meet the user's intent?
- **Creativity:** Is the response imaginative or engaging?
- **Consistency:** Does it match prior outputs or user inputs?

### a) Measuring accuracy

**Example:** A chatbot answering a factual query "What is the population of France?"

**Recommendations:**

- Reference scoring: Compare the output to a predefined ground truth for correctness.
- Human evaluation: Use for nuanced questions or when ground truth is unavailable.
- Word-level metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE): Measure token overlap between generated and reference outputs for precise tasks.

### b) Comparing two prompt versions

**Example:** Testing whether an updated summarization prompt performs better than the previous version.

**Recommendations:**

- A/B testing: Put outputs side-by-side for human evaluators or users to pick the better one.
- LLM-as-a-judge: Automate A/B testing by using a carefully-designed evaluation prompt.

### c) Evaluating edge cases or critical outputs

**Example:** Assessing a medical assistant recommending treatment options.

**Recommendations:**

- Human evaluation: Involve domain experts to ensure safety, reliability, and compliance.
- Reference scoring: Use authoritative sources to build a dataset as benchmarks.
- A/B testing: Experiment with a modified prompt or tweak model parameters to improve accuracy.

### d) Measuring usability

**Example:** A virtual assistant handling user queries in a help desk scenario.

**Recommendations:**

- Real user feedback: Analyze explicit ratings (e.g., thumbs up/down) and implicit behaviors (e.g., engagement time or rejection rates).
- Human evaluation: Pre-deployment tests for adherence to tone, accuracy, and helpfulness.

### e) Assessing creative outputs

**Example:** Generating a poetry or brainstorming a story idea.

**Recommendations:**

- Scoring: Use human evaluators to rate outputs on creativity, coherence, and adherence to style guidelines.
- Human evaluation: Crucial for subjective tasks where creativity and engagement matter most.
- LLM-as-a-judge: Automate creative evaluations using fine-tuned models if cost or scalability is a concern. */}

## Bottom Line

Effective prompt testing isn't optional—it's essential for building reliable AI applications. Without it, you risk delivering inconsistent experiences, wasting API costs, and potentially damaging user trust.

The most successful teams approach prompt engineering as a data-driven discipline. They:

- Establish clear metrics tied to business outcomes
- Test systematically with real-world data
- Maintain version control over their prompts
- Use the right tools to automate repetitive tasks
- Make evidence-based decisions before pushing to production

Remember that prompt engineering is inherently iterative. Even small improvements compound over time, resulting in significantly better user experiences and more efficient resource usage.
