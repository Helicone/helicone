## Components to improve LLM prompts

### Data collection

You need high-quality input variables to create high-quality prompts.¬†A common practice is to use ‚Äú**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>golden datasets</span>**‚Äù - data that‚Äôs meticulously cleaned and labeled - to tune your prompt for problems that are easily reproducible.

Complementing this approach, teams like QA Wolf also use **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>randomly sampled production data</span>**, which represents actual user interactions and offers a more accurate representation of real-world use cases. QA Wolf uses Helicone as their observability tool to log every LLM request and export comprehensive datasets that can be used to further fine-tune their LLMs.

### Prompt management

Prompt registries are specialized tools to help engineers **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>version, manage or improve prompts</span>**, and roll back to a previous version easily.

### Prompt playgrounds

Playgrounds are **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>interactive environments</span>** that helps engineers iteratively test and refine their prompts. Notably, playgrounds allows you to view detailed prompt/response pairs, create and iterate on prompt templates, experiment with model configurations and test prompts in real-time.

### Evaluators & scores

Feedback is essential for continuous improvement. The best tools close the loop with **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>quantitative scoring</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>scalable quality assessment</span>** of LLM outputs. They make it easy to compare different prompt variations and help engineers justify prompt changes with data before pushing to production

_Steps to test your prompt: log > evaluate > experiment > deploy_

##Preparation

### **Step 1: Log your LLM requests**

Use an observability tool to log your LLM requests and track key metrics like usage, latency, cost, time-to-first-token (TTFT). These tools provide dashboards to help you monitor irregularity, such as:

- Rising error rates
- Sudden spikes in API costs.
- Declining user satisfaction scores.

This data helps you identify when it‚Äôs time to improve your prompt.

## Testing Process

### Step 2: Create prompt variations

Experiment with prompt versions using <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-shot prompting</a>. Testing environments like Helicone makes it easier to track prompt versions, inputs, and outputs, while also providing rollback capabilities if changes lead to underperformance/regression.

### Step 3: Use real data to generate outputs

Run your prompts on real-world datasets to ensure they can handle variability and edge cases. There are 2 options:

- **Golden datasets**: Curated inputs with known expected outputs.
- **Randomly sampled production data**: More representative of real-world scenarios. (Learn <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-evaluation-for-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why this approach is better.</a>)

### Step 4: Compare outputs

Evaluate the performance of your prompts using the best methods that suits your goals and capacity, such as:

- **Real user feedback** for subjective insights.
- **Human evaluators** for nuanced assessments.
- **LLM-as-a-judge** for scalable and efficient comparisons.

### Step 5: Push the best prompt to production

Once you've identified the best-performing prompt, deploy it to production. Remember to continue to monitor your application using observability tools to track metrics and identify opportunities for further refinement.

# How to evaluate prompts before and after deployment

Evaluating prompts is about assessing how effectively your inputs‚Äîsuch as prompts and context‚Äîgenerate the desired outputs. Unlike generic model benchmarks, evaluations are tailored to your specific use case, providing targeted insights into performance.

## Key Evaluation Methods

![Add preset or custom evaluators to score your LLM outputs](/static/blog/test-your-llm-prompts/evaluator.webp)

_Add preset or custom evaluators to score your LLM outputs._

### 1. Real user feedback

Collect feedback directly from users to gauge how well your LLM performs in real-world scenarios. This can be done through feature implementation to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>solicit explicit feedback</span>**, such as thumbs up/down rating or scoring outputs, or by **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>analyzing implicit user behaviors</span>**, like time spent engaging with responses or completion rates.

**Bottom Line**

Getting user feedback is very useful for understanding practical challenges, but it can be time-consuming and subjective. However, only when your users use your product over time, will you start receiving feedback to improve upon. How can we evaluate prompts before deployment? Let‚Äôs look at some alternative evaluation methods.

### 2. Human evaluators

Use human reviewers to assess output quality based on specific criteria like relevance, tone, or correctness. This method usually begins with building a test dataset that human evaluators will compare the output against.

Based on the output, evaluators will score the response with `yes/no`, `0-10` (direct scoring) or is given a set of LLM responses where the evaluator will pick the better response (known as A/B testing or pairwise comparisons).

**Bottom Line**

Human evaluation is highly reliable for nuanced situations but is resource-intensive because the ground truth has to be constructed beforehand. It can also be subjective, leading to misinformation and much harder to scale.

### 3. LLM-as-a-judge

An alternative to human evaluation is using an LLM with an¬†**evaluation prompt**¬†to rate the generated outputs based on a criteria, especially for tasks like chatbot responses or complex text generation. This methods works well for both¬†**offline** and **online** evaluations.

<BottomLine
  title="üí° What is online or offline evaluation?"
  description="Online evaluation tests systems in real-time using live data and actual user interactions. It‚Äôs useful to capture dynamic real-world scenarios. In contrast, offline evaluation occurs in controlled, simulated environments using previous requests or synthetic data, allowing safe and reproducible system assessment before deployment. "
/>

**Bottom Line**

This approach can **approximate human judgment** while being more scalable and efficient. But keep in mind that LLM-assisted evaluations can inherit biases from training data, and may or may not outperform human evaluations. Creating an effective evaluation prompt is critical for this method to see reliable results.

### Deterministic testing

LLM-as-a-judge is useful for scenarios where outputs are predictable and well-defined, such as:

- **Classification tasks** (e.g., sentiment analysis - positive or negative).
- **Structured outputs** (e.g., JSON validation).
- **Constraint checks** (e.g., ensuring no profanity or meet specific formatting rules).

### Tips for success

- **Test the evaluation prompt itself:** make sure the prompt is clear and accurate.
- **Use few-shot learning**: Include good and bad examples to help guide the evaluation.
- **Temperature setting:** Set the evaluation LLM‚Äôs temperature to 0 to ensure consistent answers from LLMs.

## Why evaluating prompts is important (and difficult)

To optimize your LLM application, you need a way to **quantify its performance**. Choosing the right evaluation method is just as important as the evaluation itself because different evaluators are better suited for certain use cases. For example:

- If your LLM chatbot is designed for **technical support**, your evaluation metrics might include:
  1. Whether the response directly addresses the specific issue raised by the customer.
  2. Whether the response avoids contradictory information or irrelevant "fluff."
  3. Whether the tone is appropriate (e.g., helpful and professional).
- If your LLM handles **creative tasks** (e.g., generating stories or marketing copy), metrics should focus on:
  1. Whether the response is original, interesting and concise.
  2. Whether the response is aligned with brand guidelines or follow the desired tone.
  3. Whether the response adhere to structural requirements (e.g., word count, formatting).

### Choosing the right metrics

At the end of the day, the choice of evaluation metrics depends on your application‚Äôs goals. For example, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is ideal for assessing how well an LLM incorporates external knowledge, while domain-specific metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or accuracy are better for fine-tuned models.

---

# Examples

The first step is to understand what aspect of the LLM's output needs to be assessed:

- **Accuracy:** Does the response answer the question or solve the task?
- **Fluency:** Is the response grammatically correct and natural-sounding?
- **Relevance:** Does the response stay on topic and meet the user's intent?
- **Creativity:** Is the response imaginative or engaging?
- **Consistency:** Does it match prior outputs or user inputs?

## **a) How to measure output accuracy?**

**Example:** a chatbot answering a user query, i.e. ‚ÄúWhat is the population of France?‚Äù.

**Recommendation:**

- **reference scoring.** Compare the LLM output against a predefined ground truth for correctness as factual questions often have definitive answers.
- **human evaluation** if ground truth is unavailable or requires nuanced judgment.
- **word-level metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE)** to compare generated and reference outputs on token overlap whenever accuracy at a granular level matters.

## **b) How to compare two prompt versions?**

**Example:** verify whether an updated summarization prompt performs better than the old one.

**Recommendation:**

- **A/B Testing:** Put outputs side-by-side for human evaluators or users to pick the better one, direct comparison can highlight improvements or regressions.
- **LLM-as-a-judge** to automate A/B testing using a well-configured evaluation prompt.

## **c) How to evaluate edge cases or critical outputs?**

**Example:** in the legal or medical contexts, i.e. a medical assistant recommending treatment options.

**Recommendation:**

- **human evaluations:** domain experts are involved to ensure output safety and reliability.
- **reference scoring:** authoritative sources are used to build a test dataset.
- **A/B testing:** modify your prompt, parameters, or models to improve safety and accuracy.

## **d) How to measure usability based on user feedback?**

**Example:** a virtual assistant responding to user prompts in a help desk scenario.

**Recommendation:**

- **Real user feedback (explicit or implicit):** Use live data to track user engagement, response acceptability, or rejection rates.
- **Human evaluation:** Pre-deployment tests for adherence to tone, accuracy, and helpfulness.

## **e) How to assess creative outputs?**

**Example:** Generating a poetry or brainstorming a story idea.

**Recommendation:**

- **Scoring:** Use human evaluators to rate outputs on creativity, coherence, and adherence to style rules.
- **Human Evaluation:** Essential for subjective tasks where creativity and engagement matter most.
- **LLM-Generated Evaluation:** Fine-tune a model to critique creative outputs if cost is a concern.

## Bottom Line

The ultimate goal of evaluating LLM outputs is to make sure your metrics align with user expectations and deliver an enjoyable experience. A tight feedback loop with your users is key.

There‚Äôs no hard limit on how many variations of a prompt you should test. Prompt engineering should be iterative‚Äîexperiment, analyze, and adapt until the LLM output consistently meets your standards. Whether you're just starting or optimizing at scale, the process is a journey, not a one-off task.
