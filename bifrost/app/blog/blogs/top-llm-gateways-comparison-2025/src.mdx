Running multiple LLMs in production is complex. You need to manage different API formats, handle provider outages, optimize costs, and monitor performance—all while keeping latency low. 

Fortunately, **LLM Gateways** (or LLM routers) can help solve these problems, acting as intelligent gateways between your application and AI providers and becoming a must-have for anyone building production-scale AI applications.

## Why You Need an LLM Gateway

Integrating LLMs via direct API calls seems simple until you hit production and start to scale. Here are some things that could go wrong:

- **Provider Lock-in**: Your codebase becomes tightly coupled to a given provider's API format. Switching to a different provider means rewriting everything.

- **No Redundancy**: When your provider goes down (and they all do), your application goes down with it.

- **Cost Blindness**: You discover your AI spend only when the monthly bill arrives. By then, it's too late.

- **Performance Guesswork**: You don't know which provider is fastest for your use case, or how to optimize routing.

LLM routers abstract these complexities behind a unified interface while adding intelligent routing, automatic failovers, and real-time observability.

## How to Choose the Best LLM Router

Here are five key things to consider when selecting the best LLM router:

- **Core Functionality**: How well does it route requests, unify APIs, and handle deployments?
- **Optimization**: What cost-saving features, caching mechanisms, and performance tools does it offer?
- **Integration**: How easy is setup? What frameworks are supported? How customizable is it?
- **Reliability**: Does it provide monitoring, load-balancing, and failover capabilities?
- **Scalability**: How easy is it to scale as your application grows?

Let's now take a look at each router in detail.

## 1.Helicone AI Gateway

![Helicone AI Gateway Flowchart](/static/blog/top-llm-gateways-comparison-2025/ai-gateway.webp)

The Helicone <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/gateway/config" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Gateway</a> is one of the few LLM routers written in the highly performant Rust programming language. 

It provides ultra-fast performance (e.g., 8ms P50 latency) and is horizontally scalable. It also features a single binary deployment, making it simple to run on AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem, Kubernetes, Docker, or bare metal.

It also integrates seamlessly with Helicone's observability tools, providing real-time insights into provider performance and usage patterns.

### Standout Features

- **Speed**: Built with Rust making it lightweight and super fast.
- **Latency + PeakEWMA Load-Balancing**: Tracks real-time latency and load across providers using moving averages. Routes to the fastest available provider for up to 40% latency reduction.
- **Built-in Observability**: Native cost tracking, latency metrics, and error monitoring with Helicone's LLM Observability tools and OpenTelemetry integrations. Real-time dashboards show provider performance and usage patterns.
- **Intelligent Caching**: Redis-based caching with configurable TTL reduces costs by up to 95%. Cross-provider compatibility—cache OpenAI responses, serve for Anthropic requests.
- **Multi-Level Rate Limiting**: Granular controls across users, teams, providers, and global limits. Distributed enforcement prevents quota overruns in multi-instance deployments.
- **Health-Aware Routing**: Automatic provider health monitoring with circuit breaking. Removes failing providers and tests for recovery without manual intervention.
- **Regional Load-Balancing**: Routes to nearest provider regions automatically for global applications.

### Getting Started with Helicone AI Gateway

Here's how to migrate from direct API calls to AI Gateway in minutes:

#### Run container, adding necessary API keys

```bash
docker run -d --name helix \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key \
  helicone/helix:latest
```

#### Use any model via the OpenAI SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/ai",
    api_key="sk--xxxx" # Dummy key, gateway manages auth
)

# Route to any provider through the same interface, we handle the rest.
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",  # Or openai/gpt-4o, gemini/gemini-2.5-pro, etc.
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Helix!"}]
)

```

And that's it!

<FAQ 
 items={[
   {
     question: "What is an LLM gateway and why do I need one?",
     answer: "An LLM gateway (or LLM router) acts as an intelligent gateway between your application and multiple AI providers. It handles API format differences, manages failovers during provider outages, optimizes costs through smart routing, and provides monitoring capabilities. Without one, you're stuck with provider lock-in, no redundancy when services go down, and blind spots in your AI spending."
   },
   {
     question: "How does Helicone AI Gateway compare to using providers directly?",
     answer: "Helicone AI Gateway adds a thin layer that provides automatic failover, load-balancing, caching (up to 95% cost savings), and comprehensive observability. Direct provider integration means rewriting code when switching providers, no backup during outages, and limited visibility into performance and costs. The Gateway adds minimal latency (~50ms) while providing significant reliability and cost benefits."
   },
   {
     question: "Which LLM router is best for production use?",
     answer: "For production environments, Helicone AI Gateway and LiteLLM are the strongest options. Helicone excels with its Rust-based performance, sophisticated load-balancing algorithms, and native observability integration. LiteLLM offers maximum customization but requires more technical setup. OpenRouter and Portkey work well for specific use cases, while Unify AI is better suited for basic routing needs."
   },
   {
     question: "How much does it cost to use an LLM gateway?",
     answer: "Pricing varies significantly. Helicone AI Gateway and LiteLLM are open-source and free to self-host. OpenRouter adds a 5% markup on all requests. Portkey starts at $49/month. Unify AI offers a free tier with pay-as-you-go pricing. Consider both the router costs and potential savings from features like caching and intelligent routing when evaluating total cost."
   },
   {
     question: "How difficult is it to set up an LLM gateway?",
     answer: "Setup difficulty varies by router. OpenRouter, Helicone AI Gateway, and Portkey can be configured in under 5 minutes with simple API changes. LiteLLM requires 15-30 minutes of technical setup including YAML configuration. Unify AI takes 5-10 minutes. All routers provide documentation, but technical complexity increases with advanced features like custom routing algorithms or distributed deployments."
   },
   {
     question: "What happens when an LLM provider goes down?",
     answer: "Quality routers handle provider failures automatically. Helicone AI Gateway uses health-aware routing with circuit breaking to detect failures and route to healthy providers. OpenRouter and Portkey offer automatic fallbacks to backup providers. LiteLLM provides advanced retry logic with configurable cooldowns. Without a router, your application fails when your provider fails."
   },
   {
     question: "Do LLM gateways add latency to requests?",
     answer: "Yes, but it's minimal and often offset by performance improvements. Helicone AI Gateway (built with Rust) adds ~50ms latency. Other routers add 50-200ms depending on features enabled. However, intelligent routing often reduces overall latency by selecting faster providers, and caching can eliminate latency entirely for repeated requests. The reliability benefits typically outweigh the small latency cost."
