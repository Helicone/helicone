LLM caching is the process of storing and reusing previously computed responses from a large language model (LLM). Instead of generating a new response for every request, caching enables quick retrieval of results, reducing both response times and computational costs.

![How to Implement Effective LLM Caching](/static/blog/effective-llm-caching/cover.webp)

Deploying LLMs presents significant challenges:

- high operational costs, latency due to processing time
- scalability limitations when handling large volumes of requests.

Without caching, every user request requires a full computation, even if the same query has been processed before. Implementing an effective caching strategy mitigates these issues, making LLM applications more responsive and cost-efficient.

This article takes a deep dive into LLM caching strategies and design patterns and provides developers with practical tips to optimize their LLM deployments.

Let's get into it!

## Types of LLM Caching Strategies

There are two primary LLM caching strategies: exact key caching and semantic caching.

|                       | **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exact Key Caching** | Fast retrieval, simple implementation              | Sensitive to minor variations in input, such as added spaces or typos                    |
| **Semantic Caching**  | Handles reworded queries, increases cache hit rate | Potential false positives (e.g., similar prompts leading to unintended cached responses) |

### Exact Key Caching

Exact key caching works by storing responses for specific input queries. If a user submits the exact same input, the cached response is returned instead of querying the LLM again.

#### Example:

```python
# First request (cache miss)
response_1 = openai.Completion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    prompt="What is OpenAI?"
)
# Response time: 4 seconds

# Second request (cache hit)
response_2 = openai.Completion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    prompt="What is OpenAI?"
)
# Response time: 30 milliseconds
```

  description="Exact key caching is a simple and fast retrieval method that works well for applications with few unique queries. However, it is sensitive to minor variations in input, such as added spaces or typos."
/>

### Semantic Caching

Semantic caching stores responses based on meaning rather than exact input. If two inputs have similar intent, the cached response is used.

#### Example:

```python
# First request
response_1 = openai.Completion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    prompt="Explain caching in AI."
)
# Response time: 5 seconds

# Similar request (cache hit using semantic match)
response_2 = openai.Completion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    prompt="Can you describe AI caching?"
)
# Response time: 1 second
```

<BottomLine

  description="Semantic caching is a more flexible method that increases cache hit rate and handles queries that are similar well. However, it can lead to potential false positives."

## Caching Design Patterns

Let's take a quick look at some common LLM caching design patterns you might implement.

### Single LLM Caching Layer

A single caching layer sits between the user and the LLM, checking for cached responses before forwarding requests to the model.

**Workflow:**

1. User submits a query.
2. Cache checks for an exact match.
3. If found, returns the cached response.
4. If not, forwards the request to the LLM, stores the response, and returns it.

### Multi-Layer Caching

A multi-layer caching system enhances response retrieval by incorporating multiple levels of caching techniques, optimizing both speed and relevance of stored results.

A simple multi-layer system may work like this:

- **Layer 1: Exact Key Matching**

  - This layer checks for an exact match of the input query in the cache. If a match is found, the cached response is returned immediately, ensuring the fastest possible retrieval.
  - **Example:** If a user asks "What is Photosynthesis?" and the same query exists in the cache, the precomputed response is delivered instantly.

- **Layer 2: Semantic Caching**
  - If no exact match is found, the request is processed through a semantic caching layer, which uses NLP techniques to detect similar queries and retrieve an appropriate response.
  - **Example:** If the query "Explain Photosynthesis" is submitted, semantic caching may recognize it as similar to "What is Photosynthesis?" and return the corresponding cached response, even if it is not an exact match.

By leveraging this hierarchical structure, multi-layer caching ensures a higher cache hit rate, reduces redundant model invocations, and maintains a balance between precision and flexibility.

This approach is particularly useful for applications with diverse user queries, improving overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### RAG-Based Caching

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models use caching in two ways:

- **Pre-Retrieval Caching:** Stores retrieved documents before LLM processing, reducing repeated knowledge base lookups.
- **Post-Retrieval Caching:** Stores responses after document retrieval, avoiding unnecessary model invocations. This method ensures users receive fast responses while still using up-to-date data.

**Pros:** Reduces latency for knowledge-intensive applications

**Cons:** Requires careful management to prevent outdated responses

## How to Monitor and Improve Cache Performance

Here are a few strategies to optimize your LLM caching performance:

### 1. Optimize Cache Hit Rates

Maximizing cache hits reduces redundant model calls and improves efficiency.

Strategies such as **increasing cache duration** for high-frequency queries and **using both exact and semantic caching** can significantly boost hit rates.

Monitor and analyze access patterns to fine-tune caching rules.

### 2. Balance Cache Size with Memory Usage

A larger cache can store more data but consumes more memory.

Fine-tune cache <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-eviction-vs-expiration-in-system-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expiration policies and eviction strategies</a> (e.g., Least Recently Used (LRU)) to maintain efficiency.

Use monitoring tools to track memory impact and adjust accordingly.
