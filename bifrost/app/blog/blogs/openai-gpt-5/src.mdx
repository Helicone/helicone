## When is GPT-5 coming out?

According to recent statements, GPT-5 is expected to be <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released within months</a> (mid-2025), possibly during Microsoft’s Build developer conference — which starts on May 19th, 2025. 

GPT-4.5 was initially slated for a release in early 2025, with the now-released <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gpt-4.5-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4.5</a> originally slated for a December 2024 debut.

{/* This model takes a more methodological and slower approach to support tasks in mathematics, science, and other areas requiring accuracy and logical reasoning. OpenAI faces limitations in shipping multiple models in parallel.

> All of these models have gotten quite complex and we can't ship as many things in parallel as we'd like to. We also face a lot of limitations and hard decisions about [where] we allocate...our computers towards.

## What can we expect from GPT-5?

There haven’t been specific benchmarks released for GPT-5 compared to past models. However, GPT-5 is expected to introduce significant advancements based on the trends observed in previous GPT iterations. Here's what you can expect:

#### 1. Better Performance

GPT-5 is likely to surpass GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1 in complex reasoning tasks. It may achieve higher accuracy in STEM fields, potentially exceeding <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank">GPT-o1's 83% on International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exams</a>. Moreover, GPT-5 might introduce architectural innovations that improve its efficiency, potentially allowing it to run on smaller devices or with lower computational resources.

#### 2. Seamless integration of regular and reasoning models

GPT-5 will integrate both the o-series and GPT-series models into a unified system, eliminating the need for users to manually select which model to use for different tasks. 

This integration should provide a more seamless user experience where the system automatically leverages the appropriate capabilities (whether general language processing or specialized reasoning) based on the specific query or task at hand.

#### 3. Multimodal Capabilities

GPT-5 is expected to offer more seamless integration of text, images, audio, and video processing, improving upon GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities. Unlike GPT-4o, which handles text, images, and voice, GPT-5 is anticipated to work with audiovisual data in a more cohesive manner.

#### 4. Larger Context Window

We are anticipating a significant increase in context window size, potentially allowing for the processing of much longer inputs and outputs.

#### 5. Better Reasoning Abilities

GPT-5 will integrate <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI o3's</a> superior Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities, offering advanced problem-solving capabilities.

#### 6. Increased Task Complexity

GPT-5 is speculated to handle more complex tasks, possibly up to "five-hour tasks" with up to 1,000 discrete steps.

It's important to note that these (except point #2) are speculative improvements based on industry trends and statements from OpenAI executives. The actual capabilities of GPT-5 will only be known upon its release, which is anticipated in mid-2025.

## What is the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-5?

GPT-5 is expected to introduce several advancements including **multilingual support** over GPT-4. The new model will incorporate **more advanced architectures** like graph neural networks and enhanced attention mechanisms, enabling more efficient and accurate language processing.

GPT-5 will also leverage unsupervised learning on a **larger and more diverse dataset**, allowing it to better understand complex language, including concepts like sarcasm and irony. Additionally, GPT-5 is anticipated to support multiple languages and have an even greater number of parameters, potentially over 200 billion, further enhancing its text generation and multimodal capabilities compared to GPT-4.

## How much better is GPT-5?

GPT-5's accuracy and precision are expected to be higher than GPT-4o, though the exact figures are not yet available. For reference, GPT-4o has an accuracy rate of 89% in understanding and responding to contextually complex queries, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:04d84498a094b:0-what-is-gpt-4o-and-how-is-it-different-from-gpt-3-gpt-3-5-and-gpt-4/" target="_blank">compared to 84% from its predecessor GPT-4</a>. For precision, GPT-4o achieves 87% in generating relevant responses, outperforming GPT-4 (82%), GPT-3.5 (78%), and GPT-3 (73%).

While specific numbers for GPT-5 are not provided, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has expressed that GPT-5 is anticipated to be **"a lot smarter than GPT-4"** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqFAi7vkBc&ab_channel=LexFridman" target="_blank">in a podcast with Lex Fridman</a>, further explaining that GPT-5 is expected to have improved reasoning abilities, higher accuracy rates, and faster processing speeds compared to its predecessors. Additionally, GPT-5 aims to consistently provide the best response out of 10,000 potential answers, significantly improving reliability over GPT-4.

It integrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and AI Reinforcement Learning, outperforming GPT-4o with 83% accuracy on IMO qualifying exams and PhD-level performance in STEM tasks. GPT-o1 is also safer, better at mitigating biases, and supports longer outputs up to 26 pages. However, it has slower response times and higher costs, making GPT-4o better suited for general-purpose tasks requiring speed."
    },
    {
      question: "What is OpenAI o3?",
      answer: "OpenAI o3 is a reasoning model built for complex tasks that require deep analytical thinking and logical reasoning. It uses simulated reasoning, allowing the model to pause and reflect on internal processes before responding."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is OpenAI delaying the release of GPT-5?",
      answer: "The growing complexity and scale of OpenAI's models make it difficult to develop multiple advanced systems simultaneously. OpenAI is focused on scaling computing resources and ensuring quality, reliability, and performance before releasing GPT-5."
    },
    {
      question: "How does OpenAI’s approach compare to competitors like Meta and Google?",
      answer: "OpenAI is aggressively pushing new products and upgrading models to stay ahead of Meta and Google. While all players advance AI capabilities, OpenAI is currently prioritizing performance, reliability, and refinement over rapid major releases."
