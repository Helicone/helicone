## When is GPT-5 coming out?

According to recent statements, GPT-5 is expected to be **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>released in early 2025</span>**. In the meantime, <a href="https://wccftech.com/openai-ceo-says-no-gpt-5-in-2024/" target="_blank">OpenAI will be focusing on GPT-o1</a>, previously codenamed "Project Strawberry". This model takes a more methodological and slower approach to support tasks in mathematics, science, and other areas requiring accuracy and logical reasoning. OpenAI faces limitations in shipping multiple models in parallel.

> All of these models have gotten quite complex and we can't ship as many things in parallel as we'd like to. We also face a lot of limitations and hard decisions about [where] we allocate...our computers towards.

## What can we expect from GPT-5?

There hasn’t been specific benchmarks released of GPT-5 compared to past models. However, GPT-5 is expected to introduce significant advancement based on the trends observed in previous GPT iterations. Here's what you can expect:

#### 1. Better Performance

GPT-5 is likely to surpass GPT-4o and GPT-o1 in complex reasoning tasks. It may achieve higher accuracy in STEM fields, potentially exceeding <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank">GPT-o1's 83% on International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exams</a>. Moreover, GPT-5 might introduce architectural innovations that improve its efficiency, potentially allowing it to run on smaller devices or with lower computational resources.

#### 2. Multimodal Capabilities

GPT-5 is expected to offer more seamless integration of text, images, audio, and video processing, improving upon GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities. Unlike GPT-4o, which handles text, images, and voice, GPT-5 is anticipated to work with audiovisual data in a more cohesive manner.

#### 3. Larger Context Window

We are anticipating significant increase in context window size, potentially allowing for processing of much longer inputs and outputs.

#### 4. Better Reasoning Abilities

GPT-5 may build upon GPT-o1's Chain-of-Thought reasoning, offering even more sophisticated problem-solving capabilities.

#### 5. Increased Task Complexity

GPT-5 is speculated to handle more complex tasks, possibly up to "five-hour tasks" with up to 1,000 discrete steps.

It's important to note that these are speculative improvements based on industry trends and statements from OpenAI executives. The actual capabilities of GPT-5 will only be known upon its release, which is anticipated in early 2025.

## What is the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-5?

GPT-5 is expected to introduce several advancements including **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>multilingual support</span>** over GPT-4. The new model will incorporate **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>more advanced architectures</span>** like graph neural networks and enhanced attention mechanisms, enabling more efficient and accurate language processing.

GPT-5 will also leverage unsupervised learning on a **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>larger and more diverse dataset</span>**, allowing it to better understand complex language, including concepts like sarcasm and irony. Additionally, GPT-5 is anticipated to support multiple languages and have an even greater number of parameters, potentially over 200 billion, further enhancing its text generation and multimodal capabilities compared to GPT-4.

## FAQ

### **What is GPT-o1, and how is it different from previous models?**

GPT-o1, formerly known as Project Strawberry, is a new model designed to excel at tasks requiring advanced logical reasoning, accuracy, and step-by-step problem-solving. Unlike earlier models such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1 integrates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and AI Reinforcement Learning to handle complex STEM-related problems more effectively. In fact, GPT-o1 outperforms GPT-4o, achieving 83% accuracy on IMO qualifying exams and performing at a PhD-level in STEM tasks.

In addition to improved accuracy and reasoning capabilities, GPT-o1 is safer, better at mitigating biases, and can produce longer outputs of up to 26 pages. However, these benefits come with certain trade-offs: GPT-o1 has slower response times and higher costs, making it a more specialized tool for complex reasoning scenarios. Conversely, GPT-4o remains better suited for general-purpose applications where speed and efficiency are paramount.

### **Why is OpenAI delaying the release of GPT-5?**

The complexity and scale of OpenAI’s models have grown significantly, making it challenging to develop multiple advanced systems in parallel. By focusing on GPT-o1 this year, OpenAI aims to better allocate its computing resources and ensure higher quality, more reliable performance before moving on to the next major version.

### **How does OpenAI’s approach compare to competitors like Meta and Google?**

OpenAI has adopted an aggressive and forward-looking approach, continually launching new products and upgrading existing models to stay ahead of competitors like Meta and Google. While all companies work on advancing AI capabilities, OpenAI’s current focus is on refining performance and reliability rather than simply pushing rapid major releases.

### What are some of the anticipated use cases and applications for GPT-5?

GPT-5 is expected to excel at complex reasoning tasks, demonstrate stronger comprehension and multilingual support, and have enhanced multimodal integration compared to prior GPT models. This could enable more advanced applications in areas like scientific research, data analysis, and conversational AI.
