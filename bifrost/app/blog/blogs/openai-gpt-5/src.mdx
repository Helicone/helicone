## When is GPT-5 coming out?

According to recent statements, GPT-5 is expected to be <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released within months</a> (mid-2025), possibly during Microsoft’s Build developer conference — which starts on May 19th, 2025.

GPT-4.5 was initially slated for a release in early 2025, with the now-released <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gpt-4.5-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4.5</a> originally slated for a December 2024 debut.

{/\* This model takes a more methodological and slower approach to support tasks in mathematics, science, and other areas requiring accuracy and logical reasoning. OpenAI faces limitations in shipping multiple models in parallel.

> All of these models have gotten quite complex and we can't ship as many things in parallel as we'd like to. We also face a lot of limitations and hard decisions about [where] we allocate...our computers towards.

## What can we expect from GPT-5?

There haven’t been specific benchmarks released for GPT-5 compared to past models. However, GPT-5 is expected to introduce significant advancements based on the trends observed in previous GPT iterations. Here's what you can expect:

#### 1. Better Performance

GPT-5 is likely to surpass GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1 in complex reasoning tasks. It may achieve higher accuracy in STEM fields, potentially exceeding <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="_blank">GPT-o1's 83% on International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exams</a>. Moreover, GPT-5 might introduce architectural innovations that improve its efficiency, potentially allowing it to run on smaller devices or with lower computational resources.

#### 2. Seamless integration of regular and reasoning models

GPT-5 will integrate both the o-series and GPT-series models into a unified system, eliminating the need for users to manually select which model to use for different tasks.

This integration should provide a more seamless user experience where the system automatically leverages the appropriate capabilities (whether general language processing or specialized reasoning) based on the specific query or task at hand.

#### 3. Multimodal Capabilities

GPT-5 is expected to offer more seamless integration of text, images, audio, and video processing, improving upon GPT-4o's multimodal capabilities. Unlike GPT-4o, which handles text, images, and voice, GPT-5 is anticipated to work with audiovisual data in a more cohesive manner.

#### 4. Larger Context Window

We are anticipating a significant increase in context window size, potentially allowing for the processing of much longer inputs and outputs.

#### 5. Better Reasoning Abilities

GPT-5 will integrate <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI o3's</a> superior Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities, offering advanced problem-solving capabilities.

#### 6. Increased Task Complexity

GPT-5 is speculated to handle more complex tasks, possibly up to "five-hour tasks" with up to 1,000 discrete steps.

It's important to note that these (except point #2) are speculative improvements based on industry trends and statements from OpenAI executives. The actual capabilities of GPT-5 will only be known upon its release, which is anticipated in mid-2025.

## What is the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-5?

GPT-5 is expected to introduce several advancements including **multilingual support** over GPT-4. The new model will incorporate **more advanced architectures** like graph neural networks and enhanced attention mechanisms, enabling more efficient and accurate language processing.

GPT-5 will also leverage unsupervised learning on a **larger and more diverse dataset**, allowing it to better understand complex language, including concepts like sarcasm and irony. Additionally, GPT-5 is anticipated to support multiple languages and have an even greater number of parameters, potentially over 200 billion, further enhancing its text generation and multimodal capabilities compared to GPT-4.

## How much better is GPT-5?

GPT-5's accuracy and precision are expected to be higher than GPT-4o, though the exact figures are not yet available. For reference, GPT-4o has an accuracy rate of 89% in understanding and responding to contextually complex queries, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:04d84498a094b:0-what-is-gpt-4o-and-how-is-it-different-from-gpt-3-gpt-3-5-and-gpt-4/" target="_blank">compared to 84% from its predecessor GPT-4</a>. For precision, GPT-4o achieves 87% in generating relevant responses, outperforming GPT-4 (82%), GPT-3.5 (78%), and GPT-3 (73%).

While specific numbers for GPT-5 are not provided, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has expressed that GPT-5 is anticipated to be **"a lot smarter than GPT-4"** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqFAi7vkBc&ab_channel=LexFridman" target="_blank">in a podcast with Lex Fridman</a>, further explaining that GPT-5 is expected to have improved reasoning abilities, higher accuracy rates, and faster processing speeds compared to its predecessors. Additionally, GPT-5 aims to consistently provide the best response out of 10,000 potential answers, significantly improving reliability over GPT-4.
