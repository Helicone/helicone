> We lost $800 on LLM retries last week—and didn’t even know it until a user complained.

> We shipped a broken tool call chain to prod. It took us 3 hours to trace the root cause.

> We changed one prompt, and our cost per request doubled. No one noticed for a week.

These aren’t edge cases. They're very common problems teams run into once their LLM app hits production.

![Build vs. Buy LLM Observability](/static/blog/buy-vs-build-llm-observability/buy-vs-build.webp)

As more teams ship LLM-powered apps, observability has gone from a nice-to-have to a baseline requirement. But here’s the real question: **Should you build LLM observability yourself, or just buy it?**

We’ve seen teams try both. This guide lays out what it actually takes to build from scratch — and when buying helps you move faster without burning cycles on infra. No sales pitch, just what we’ve learned building LLM apps ourselves.


## TL;DR: Build vs. Buy

### ✅ Build If:
- You have **very specific infra requirements** or custom needs.
- You have **strict data privacy or compliance constraints**.
- You already have **internal logging systems** you can extend.
- You have **time and bandwidth** to maintain it.

### ✅ Buy If:
- You want to **ship faster** and not spend weeks on infra.
- You need **production visibility now**, not next quarter.
- You’re looking for **built-in dashboards, evals, retries, and tracing**.
- You want to **compare models, track cost, debug prompts** without reinventing the wheel.

## How to build LLM observability from scratch

Building your own LLM observability tooling might sound straightforward — log some requests, capture outputs, throw together a few dashboards — but once you get into it, you start pulling a thread that never ends. Here’s a peek into what that journey actually looks like:

You start with logging: prompts, responses, latency. Then someone asks about retries. Or rate limits. Or cost tracking. Then you realize your app isn’t just single requests — it’s chains, tools, and multi-step agents. Now you need trace trees.

Prompts change weekly, so you build versioning. Then you want to test which one’s better — so you manually A/B test on a few examples, realize that doesn’t scale, and build a test harness. Then you add evals, scoring, dashboards, feedback, redaction... and now you’ve got a small observability platform on your hands.

Here’s a simplified list of what you’ll need to wrangle:

| Category            | What you have to build |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Logging             | Capture model requests, responses, latency, tokens, cost, retries |
| Tracing             | Map multi-step agent calls or toolchains |
| Prompt Versioning   | Store and compare prompt versions over time — <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we covered how to do this effectively</a> |
| Dashboards          | Cost, latency, success rate, error tracking |
| Real-world Testing  | Run prompt variations on actual production inputs |
| Eval Pipelines      | Automatic/manual evals with metrics and scores |
| Alerting            | Anomaly detection on cost, latency, errors |
| Feedback Loop       | Capture and connect user feedback to responses |
| Multi-Model Support | Normalize across OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc. |
| Privacy & Security  | Handle redaction, encryption, audit logs |

Even teams that start building often end up cobbling together a system that kind of works — and quietly wish they’d started with a tool.

One company that went the build route is <a href="https://incident.io/building-with-ai/built-our-own-ai-tooling#try-before-you-buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incident.io</a>. They built internal LLM tooling to support drafting incident summaries and debugging workflows. Their rationale? They wanted tight feedback loops, transparency, and fast iteration — and weren’t satisfied with off-the-shelf platforms.

But even they admit it was a major investment. Their advice: “Try before you buy. But if you’re thinking about building, be clear what your north star is — otherwise, you risk spending weeks on infra instead of shipping value.”

**In short:** Building your own observability stack is possible — and for some teams, even necessary. But it comes with a list of hidden costs. Know your goals, your bandwidth, and your tolerance for infrastructure overhead before you dive in.

## What you get when you buy

Most observability platforms handle all the above — plus:

- **Session debugging**: Trace step-by-step calls, retries, and nested tool use
- **Prompt diffs**: See what changed and how it affected outputs
- **Model comparisons**: Measure GPT-4o vs Claude 3.5 (and more) — <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/how-to-monitor-claude-3-5-sonnet-vs-gpt-4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s a hands-on guide</a>
- **Spreadsheet-like testing**: Run prompt variations at scale
- **Built-in evals**: Measure quality with out-of-the-box or custom metrics
- **Open-source options**: Use self-hosted or hosted versions

## Helicone vs Langfuse: Quick Comparison

There are a few great observability platforms out there — and two that frequently come up are **Helicone** and **Langfuse**. If you're wondering which one might be a better fit for your workflow, here’s a quick side-by-side.

| Feature                        | **Helicone**                                | **Langfuse**                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Setup Speed**               | ✅ Fast — 1-line proxy or SDK wrapper        | ✅ SDK setup + manual config           |
| **Prompt Testing (Prod Data)**| ✅ Yes — spreadsheet UI with real inputs     | ⚠️ Limited — mostly sandboxed          |
| **Trace Trees**               | ✅ Yes — for retries, tool use, and sessions | ✅ Yes — works best with LangChain      |
| **Eval Support**              | ✅ Real-world data and metrics               | ✅ Strong support in test environments  |
| **Model Comparison**          | ✅ Easy side-by-side (GPT-4o vs Claude)      | ⚠️ Manual setup                         |
| **Pricing**                   | ✅ Startup-friendly and usage-based          | ⚠️ Higher entry point                   |
| **Open Source License**       | ✅ MIT (fully open source)                   | ⚠️ BSL (source available, but limited)  |

**Summary:**

- Choose **Helicone** if you want something fast, flexible, and great for live debugging and testing in production.
- Choose **Langfuse** if you're building structured multi-step agents (especially with LangChain) and want deep trace detail with built-in eval workflows.

## Testing and Debugging Your LLM App

Let’s say you’re trying to evaluate Claude 3.5 vs GPT-4o using real user queries. Here's how you can do it in Helicone:

- Upload real production inputs (e.g. user queries)
- Add different prompt variations or model providers
- Use a spreadsheet-like UI to test everything at once
- View output quality, latency, and cost side-by-side — <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/test-your-llm-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see how this works in practice</a>

### For example:

| Input                   | Claude 3.5 Output       | GPT-4o Output              | Cost    | Latency | Tokens | Eval Score |
|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| "Summarize this article"| "Here’s a summary..."    | "The article discusses..." | $0.004  | 3.1s    | 98     | 4/5         |
| "Translate to French"   | "Bonjour, ceci est..."   | "Salut, c’est..."          | $0.005  | 2.9s    | 102    | 5/5         |

You want to see the full prompts, variable values, retry paths, and token-by-token breakdowns. Cool! Now what? 

Debugging is just as seamless. If something fails in production, you can:

- Open the session trace
- See each step (tool call, model response, retries)
- View errors, costs, or hallucinations
- Compare alternate model retries and their outputs

## Key Takeaways

Phew! That was a lot. Whether you’re a solo builder or part of a fast-moving team, LLM observability will eventually become unavoidable. It's not really about whether you need it, more about how much time you want to spend building vs. shipping.

1. **Building gives you control, but eats up time.** It's not just logs — you’ll need tracing, testing infrastructure, eval pipelines, retries, cost tracking, and more.
2. **Buying lets you move faster.** You get debugging tools, prompt/version tracking, and cost visibility out of the box — so you can focus on your app, not infrastructure.
3. **Most teams underestimate what “just logging” turns into.** It starts small, but grows into a full observability stack before you know it.
4. **Build if observability is your product.** Buy if you want to ship faster and have observability that scales with your LLM stack.
