## How to Integrate a Pre-built MCP Into Your AI Application


If you want to start quickly, you can connect an existing MCP server — no custom coding required.
MCP's plug-and-play design allows you to wire up external tools in minutes.

Let's walk through an example using the open-source <a href="https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma MCP</a>, which connects design files directly to your AI coding environment in Cursor.

### Step 1: Get Your Figma API Key

First, you'll need a Figma account and a personal API key.

Follow <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a> to generate your API key. This key allows your MCP server to securely retrieve data from your Figma projects.

### Step 2: Add the MCP Server to Your Environment

Next, connect the Figma MCP server to Cursor.

In Cursor, go to `Settings` > `MCP` > `Add new global MCP server` and paste the configuration.

#### MacOS/Linux

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windows

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink Figma MCP": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration sets up your MCP server as a local process that communicates with Cursor via standard input/output streams.

### Step 3: Test Your Figma MCP Integration

Once the MCP status turns green, you're ready to use it.

Try asking Cursor:

>Can you retrieve this Figma file and analyze the components in a few short sentences?

>**[Your Figma file URL]**

You should see an analysis similar to this:

![Figma file analysis](/static/blog/building-first-mcp-for-developers/figma-analysis.webp)

Next, you can push it further:

>Based on the chart components in this Figma file, generate reusable Tailwind + React components for a dashboard UI.

Now that you've seen how easy it is to integrate a ready-made MCP like Figma's, let's dive deeper: **what if you need more control or want to integrate services that don't have a pre-built MCP?**

In the next section, we'll show you how to build your own custom MCP server from scratch.

## How to Build a Custom MCP Server From Scratch

Sometimes, off-the-shelf tools aren't enough. If you need deeper customization, building your own Model Context Protocol (MCP) server gives you full control over how your AI interacts with external APIs. 

In this section, we'll walk you through creating a simple Weather MCP that retrieves live temperature data.

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

We'll start by initializing a new Node.js project, which will serve as the base for our custom MCP server.

```bash
mkdir weather-mcp
cd weather-mcp
npm init -y
```

This creates a new project where we'll install our MCP server code.

### Step 2: Build the Weather MCP Server

Now let's create the core logic for the MCP.

Create a new file called `main.ts`, and add the following code:

```ts
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse";
import express from "express";
import { z } from "zod";

// Utility for reliable API fetching with retries
async function fetchWithRetry(
  url: string,
  retries = 3,
  timeout = 5000
): Promise<any> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timer = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);

    try {
      const res = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
      clearTimeout(timer);
      if (!res.ok)
        throw new Error(`Fetch error: ${res.status} ${res.statusText}`);
      return await res.json();
    } catch (err) {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      if (attempt === retries) throw err;
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1000));
    }
  }
  throw new Error("Failed after retries");
}

// Create MCP server
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Weather Info MCP Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Implement the weather tool
server.tool("getCityTemperature", { city: z.string() }, async ({ city }) => {
  try {
    const geoUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(
      city
    )}&count=1`;
    const geoData = await fetchWithRetry(geoUrl);

    if (!geoData.results || geoData.results.length === 0) {
      throw new Error(`City "${city}" not found.`);
    }

    const { latitude: lat, longitude: lon } = geoData.results[0];

    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${lon}&current_weather=true`;
    const weatherData = await fetchWithRetry(weatherUrl);

    const temperature = weatherData.current_weather?.temperature;

    if (temperature === undefined) {
      throw new Error("Temperature data missing from weather response.");
    }

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: `The current temperature in ${city} is ${temperature}°C.`,
        },
      ],
    };
  } catch (err: any) {
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: `Failed to fetch temperature for ${city}: ${
            err.message || err
          }`,
        },
      ],
    };
  }
});

// Set up Express and SSE transport
const app = express();
let transport: SSEServerTransport | null = null;

app.get("/sse", (req, res) => {
  transport = new SSEServerTransport("/messages", res);
  server.connect(transport);
});

app.post("/messages", (req, res) => {
  if (transport) {
    transport.handlePostMessage(req, res);
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log("Weather MCP running at http://localhost:3000/sse");
```

**Checkpoint:** We've created a tool that takes a city name as input, fetches its coordinates, retrieves the weather, and returns a friendly natural language response.


### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk express zod
```

### Step 4: Run the MCP Server

```bash
npx tsx main.ts
```

You should see the Weather MCP running at `http://localhost:3000/sse`.  

### Step 5: Connect Your MCP Server in Cursor

Add a new global server in Cursor's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "Weather MCP Server": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3000/sse"
  }
}
```

After the connection is established, you can now ask Cursor:

>What's the weather in San Francisco?

![Weather MCP Tool Test](/static/blog/building-first-mcp-for-developers/weather-mcp-test.webp)

Cursor will call your custom MCP server, fetch live data, and return a natural language answer.

With a working Weather MCP, you now have a foundation for connecting any real-world API to your AI agent using the MCP standard.

## How to Add Observability to Your MCP Server with Helicone

Once your MCP is running, the next step is ensuring you can monitor its performance and debug issues efficiently. That’s where Helicone comes in.

Helicone provides robust observability for your LLM usage across providers like OpenAI, Claude, and Groq.

Here's how to integrate Helicone with your MCP.

### Step 1: Get API Keys

You'll need:

- A Helicone API key
- An LLM provider API key (we'll use Groq in this example)

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
HELICONE_API_KEY=<your-helicone-api-key>
```

Save these in your `.env` file:

### Step 2: Integrate Helicone with Groq

Add this to your `main.ts` file:

```ts
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq({
  apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://groq.helicone.ai",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
  },
});
```

### Step 3: Use Groq with Helicone in Your MCP

Add this code to your `server.tool` call to enhance your weather tool with AI-generated insights:

```ts
const completion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `The current temperature in ${city} is ${temperature}°C.
      Please provide a brief, one-sentence insight about what this means for the weather in ${city}.`,
    },
  ],
  model: "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
  temperature: 0.7,
});
```

With this setup, all LLM requests made through your MCP will be automatically logged and tracked in Helicone without any extra instrumentation required in your request logic.

Run your MCP server:

```bash
npx tsx main.ts
```

Alternatively, you can clone the complete repository and start your custom MCP:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yusu-f/custom-MCP-tutorial.git
cd custom-MCP-tutorial
npm init -y
npm install
npx tsx main.ts
```
