## How to Implement LLM Observability: Step-by-Step Guide

_Implementing LLM observability with Helicone is as easy as changing just one line of code!_

### Step 1: Choose Your Integration Method

Helicone offers two primary integration methods:
- **Proxy Integration**: The simplest approach that requires minimal code changes:

  ```js
  import OpenAI from "openai";

  const openai = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    baseURL: `https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/${HELICONE_API_KEY}/`
  });
  ```
- **Async Integration**: <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/openllmetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Direct logging</a> without modifying your API endpoints. 

Helicone supports any provider and framework. 

For other integration methods, check out the <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a>.

With just this step, **a lot** of your LLM observability needs are covered, but if you'd like to take it to the next level, read on!

### Step 2: Add User and Session Tracking

Enhance your data with <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/user-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user</a> and <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">session tracking</a> for better segmentation. 

This allows you to get deeper analytics per user, or per conversation for debugging purposes. 

```js
const sessionId = generateSessionId();

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: chatHistory,
  headers: {
    "Helicone-User-Id": userId, // Track user by ID
    "Helicone-Session-Id": sessionId, // Track session by ID
    "Helicone-Session-Path": "/abstract", // Defines parent-child hierarchy
    "Helicone-Session-Name": "Course Plan", 
  }
});
```
Again, you can choose to stop here, but you probably want more so let's go!

### Step 3: Implement Custom Properties

Add other specific metadata (aka. <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom properties</a>) to your requests for further data segmentation. For example, you can track feature flags, user roles, or the source of the request.

```js
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: chatHistory,
  headers: {
    "Helicone-Property-Feature": "product_recommendation",
    "Helicone-Property-User-Segment": "premium",
    "Helicone-Property-Source": "mobile_app"
  }
});
```

And that covers the basics!

## Best Practices for Improving LLM Performance in Production

*Observability tools like Helicone are designed to help you identify which of these to focus on for the greatest ROI*

### 1. Using Prompting Techniques to Reduce Hallucinations

LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate outputs that sound plausible - also known as hallucination. Hallucinations can happen frequently and undermine your user's trust.

The good news is, you can mitigate this by using the right prompting technique. 

**For example**:

- Use <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/chain-of-thought-prompting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chain-of-thought</a> to prompt the model to adopt step-by-step reasoning.
- Ground the model responses in trusted external knowledge **using RAG**. 
- **Structure the output format** to limit the model's freedom to hallucinate.
- Give **few-shot examples** for the model to follow.

Read about other <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompting techniques</a>. 

With Helicone you can <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiment with your prompting techniques</a> (even on production data) to find the best ones.

### 2. Preventing Prompt Injections

![Types of Prompt Injection](/static/blog/preventing-prompt-injection/types-of-prompt-injection.webp)

Malicious users can manipulate their inputs to trick your model into revealing sensitive information or taking risky actions. But there are ways to prevent this.

**On a high level, you can:**

- Sanitize inputs by removing special characters and injection patterns.
- Implement strict validation of user inputs.
- Block inappropriate or malicious responses.
- Monitor inputs using observability tools like Helicone and flag suspicious activities.

We dive deeper into this topic in this blog: <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to prevent prompt injections</a>.

### 3. Caching to Improve Performance and Latency

Caching stores previously generated responses, allowing applications to quickly retrieve data without additional computation.

In most use cases, latency has the most impact on the user experience. Helicone allows you to <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cache responses</a> on the edge, so that you can serve cached responses immediately without invoking the LLM API, reducing costs at the same time.

### 4. Tracking API Usage and Costs

![After using Helicone's tips to optimize LLM costs](/static/blog/slash-llm-cost/meme-2.webp)

{/* Think this merged with the before Helicone picture would be a great fit here—but like cropped */}

It's important to know exactly what is drilling a hole in your operational cost. 

In Helicone, you can actively track the cost incurred for every LLM interaction. We help you answer questions like: 

- Which model is driving your costs? 
- Is the premium justified? 
- Which users are generating the highest costs? Are power users subsidizing occasional users?
- Which features have the highest LLM spend? Is the ROI worth it?

**There are ways to optimize your LLM costs**:

- Monitoring LLM costs by project or user.
- Use cheaper models for simpler tasks, and thinking models where quality is more important than latency.
- Set rate limits for certain users or features
- Caching common responses (see #3 above)

### 5. Iterating on the Prompt

As models evolve, it's important to continuously test and audit your prompts to ensure they're performing as expected.

You should <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiment</a> with different variations of your prompt, switch models or set up different configurations to find the best-performing prompt. You should also evaluate against key metrics that are important to your business.
