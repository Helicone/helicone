## AI Agents vs. Traditional Chatbots

Unlike traditional chatbots, which follow explicit instructions or rules, AI agents can autonomously perform specific tasks with advanced decision-making abilities. They interact with their environment by collecting data, processing it, and deciding on the best actions to achieve a predefined goal.

### Examples of AI Agents

### Use of RAG to Improve Functionality

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced method that allows the agent to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>incorporate information from external knowledge bases</span>** (e.g., databases, documents, articles) into the response.

RAG significantly improved the response outcome as the agent now have access to the most recent data based on keywords, semantic similarity, or other advanced search techniques, and used it to generate more accurate, personalized, and context-specific responses.

## Core Components of AI Agents

Typically, AI agents consists of four core components:

1. **Planning**: When you define a goal, agents will plan, sequence actions and formulate strategies.

2. **Tool / Vector DB Calls**: Advanced AI Agents can interact with external tools, APIs, and services through <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling" rel="noopener" target="_blank">function calls</a> in order to handle more complicated tasks.

   For example:

   - Fetching real-time weather data or stock prices.
   - Using translation services.
   - Performing image recognition or editing using specialized libraries.
   - Running custom scripts to automate workflow.

3. **Perception**: AI agents can also process information from their environment, making them more interactive and context-aware.

   This sensory information can include visual, auditory, or other types of data, to help the agents respond appropriately to environmental cues.

4. **Memory**: AI agents are able to remember past interactions, including tools previously used and its planning decisions. These context are stored to help agents self-reflect and inform future actions.

## Challenges of Debugging AI Agents

**⚠️ Their decision making process is complicated.**

AI agent's adaptive behavior makes their decision paths **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>non-deterministic</span>** and harder to trace. This is because agents base their decisions on **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>many inputs</span>** from **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>diverse data sources</span>** (i.e. user interactions, environmental data, and internal states), and they learn through patterns and correlations identified in the data.

**⚠️ No visibility into their internal states.**

AI agents function as "black boxes” and understanding how they transform inputs into outputs is not straightforward. Often times, whenever the agent interacts with external services, APIs or other agents, their behavior is unpredictable.

**⚠️ Context builds up over time, so do errors.**

Agents can often make multiple dependent vector database calls within a single session, adding some complexity in tracing the data flow. They can also operate over a longer sessions, where **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>an early error can have cascading effects</span>**, so it's difficult to identify their original source without proper session tracking.

## Scenario 1: Debugging errors in a travel chatbot

A travel chatbot assists users in booking flights, hotels and rent cars. There are often issues with data parsing or third-party integrations. Users are frustrated with incomplete bookings.

![Case Study: Resolving Errors in Multi-Step Processes Using Helicone's Sessions](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/example-travel.webp)

### Issue

While building this chatbot, we noticed that the LLM occasionally provided incorrect parameters to the flight search API, leading to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>incorrect bookings</span>**.

### How to debug using Helicone's Sessions

1. **Go to the `Sessions` tab, find related requests**

   To examine what's causing the error, go to `Sessions`. Check out the requests that relates to the action where the error occured.

   In this case it's the `search-flights` API call.

   ![Errors in Search Flights Step](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/search-flights.webp)

2. **Take a closer look at the request**

   Next, click on the request to inspect its details.

   For example, the user input says: `I've just arrived at JFK, where can I go to reLAX?`

   In this case, the LLM misinterpreted capitalized words as airline abbreviations, mistakenly assuming the user wants to book a flight from `JFK` (New York) to `LAX` (Los Angeles).

3. **Fix the bug in Playground**

   To fix this, we go to `Playground` and improve the prompt to ignore capitalized words.

   We discovered that by converting the entire string to lowercase before passing it to the LLM, the LLM was able to correctly parse airport codes while ignoring unrelated capitalized words.

   > Unfortunately, there are no flights available from JFK at the moment that match your search for relaxation destinations.
   > You might want to consider checking for flights at different times or days, or you could explore relaxing spots within the airport such as lounges or nearby hotels.

   The chatbot now accurately interprets user intent and returns the correct departure and arrival airports, leading to more reliable flight search results.

## Scenario 2: Personalize responses to match user intent

A health and fitness chatbot that takes the user's goal to create a personalized workout and dietary plans.

![Case Study: Understanding User Intent for Personalization Using Helicone's Sessions](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/example-fitness.webp)

### Issue

Users report that the chatbot is generating **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>inconsistent dietary recommendations</span>** when prompted a few times.

In this example, the user who previously selected a high-protein diet for muscle gain might later receive a low-calorie meal plan designed for weight loss.

### How to debug using Helicone's Sessions

1. **Go to the `Sessions` tab**

   Identify recent session logs for users who reported unexpected diet plan changes.

   ![Medical Records Traces](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/fitness-bot.webp)

   As a first step, verify that users' medical records are being correctly analyzed.

2. **Analyze the "Medical History" retrieval step**

   In the `medical-history` trace, check if the chatbot is correctly retrieving users' medical history data from the vector database.

   In this case, we found that the LLM failed to lookup relevant user data from the vector DB, causing inconsistencies in retrieved dietary preferences.

3. **Fix bug in code**

   Upon reviewing the code, a bug was found in the data embedding process, leading to incorrect storage and retrieval of user data.

   After fixing the issue, tests in the `Playground` confirmed that the chatbot now consistently provides diet plans that align with user goals.

## Scenario 3: Create custom learning materials

An AI tutoring service built an AI agent that creates customized learning materials. It's important that the agent generates both accurate and comprehensive lessons.

### How to debug using Helicone's Sessions

The `Session` view will outline the structure of the generated course. Each trace in a Session shows you how the agent interpreted your requests and the corresponding content.

Skimming through, wherever the agent misunderstood topics or failed to cover key concepts, you can then fine-tune that specific prompt using the `Playground` or `Experiments`. The goal here is to generate a more thorough content while making sure it is appropriate for the student’s learning level.
