## First, what are AI agents? 

An **AI agent** is a software program that autonomously performs specific tasks using advanced decision-making abilities. It interacts with its environment by collecting data, processing it, and deciding on the best actions to achieve predefined goals.

### Types of AI Agents

#### Copilots

Copilots assist users by **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>providing suggestions and recommendations</span>**. For example, when writing code, a copilot might suggest code snippets, highlight potential bugs or offer optimization tips, but the developer decides whether to implement these suggestions.

#### Autonomous Agents

Autonomous agents perform tasks **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>independently without human intervention</span>**. For example, it can handle customer inquiries by identify issues, access account information, perform necessary actions (like processing refunds or updating account details), and respond to the customer. They can also escalate to a human agent if they encounter problems beyond their current capabilities. 

#### Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems involve **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>interactions and collaboration between multiple autonomous agents</span>** to achieve a collective goal. These systems have advantages like dynamic reasoning, the ability to distribute tasks, and better memory for retaining information.


## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation? 

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an advanced framework that allows the agent to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>incorporate information from external knowledge bases</span>** (e.g., databases, documents, articles) into the response. 

RAG significantly improves the functionality of AI agents by accessing the most recent data based on keywords, semantic similarity, or other advanced search techniques, and use it to generate more accurate, personalized, and context-specific responses.

## Four Core Components of AI Agents

Unlike traditional software programs, AI agents differ by autonomously performing tasks based on rational decision-making principles. Typically, AI agents have four components:

1. **Planning** 
2. **Tool / Vector Database Calls** 
3. **Perception** 
4. **Memory**

![How AI Agents work](/static/blog/how-agents-work.webp)


### Planning

AI agents has the ability to plan and sequence actions to achieve specific goals. The integration of LLMs has significantly improved their planning capabilities, allowing them to formulate more sophisticated and effective strategies.

### Tool / Vector Database Calls

Advanced AI Agents often interact with these external tools, APIs, and services through function calls, allowing them to handle complex operations such as: 

- Fetching real-time information from APIs (e.g., weather data, stock prices).
- Utilizing translation services to convert text between languages.
- Performing tasks like image recognition or manipulation through specialized libraries.
- Running custom scripts to automate specific workflows or computations.

### Perception

By perceiving and processing information from their environment, AI agents become more interactive and context-aware. This sensory information can include visual, auditory, and other types of data, enabling the agents to respond appropriately to different environmental cues.

### Memory

AI agents have the capacity to remember past interactions and behaviors, including previous tool usage and planning decisions. They store these experiences and can engage in self-reflection to inform future actions. This memory component provides continuity and allows for continuous improvement in their performance over time.

## Challenges of Debugging AI agents

**⚠️ Their decision making process is complicated.**

AI agents base their decisions on **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>many inputs from diverse data sources</span>** (i.e. user interactions, environmental data, and internal states). While traditional software follow explicit instructions, AI agents learn and make decisions through patterns and correlations identified in the data. Their adaptive behavior makes their decision paths **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>non-deterministic</span>** and harder to trace.

**⚠️ No visibility into their internal states.**

AI agents function as "black boxes” and understanding how it transforms inputs into outputs is not straightforward. When the agent interacts with external services, APIs or other agents, the behavior can be unpredictable. 

**⚠️ Context builds up over time, so do errors.**

AI agents often make multiple dependent vector database calls within a single session, making it difficult to trace the data flow. They can also operate over extended sessions, where **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>an early error can have cascading effects</span>**, making it difficult to identify their original source without proper session tracking.

## How Industries Debug AI Agents Using Sessions 

### Travel: Resolving Errors in Multi-Step Processes

**Challenge**

Travel chatbots assist users through flights, hotels bookings and car rentals. Errors can easily happen due to data parsing issues or integration problems with third-party services. Users are often left frustrated or have incomplete bookings.

**Solution**

![Case Study: Resolving Errors in Multi-Step Processes Using Helicone's Sessions](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/example-travel.webp)

Sessions provide a complete trace of the booking interaction, allowing developers to pinpoint exactly where users encounter problems. If users frequently report missing flight confirmations, session traces can reveal whether the issue stems from input parsing errors or glitches with airline APIs, enabling targeted fixes.


### Health & Fitness: Understanding User Intent for Personalization

**Challenge**

Health and fitness chatbots needs to accurately interpret user's asks to offer personalized workout plans and dietary advice. Misinterpretation leads to generic suggestions and unhappy users who will abandon the chatbot instantly.

**Solution**

![Case Study: Understanding User Intent for Personalization Using Helicone's Sessions](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/example-fitness.webp)

The session data reveals user preferences to help developers adjust chatbot responses. If users ask about strength training over cardio often in the session logs, developers can tweak the prompt for the chatbot to provide more relevant strength training programs.


### Education: Generating Content and Ensuring Quality

**Challenge**

AI agents that creates customized learning materials need to generate comprehensive and accurate lessons. Errors or incomplete information leads to poor learning experiences.

**Solution**

![Case Study: Generating Educational Content Using Helicone's Sessions](/static/blog/debug-agents-with-sessions/example-course-gen.webp)

Sessions trace how the agent interprets user requests and generates course content. Data can reveal where the agent misunderstood topics or failed to cover key concepts. Developers can then fine-tune the prompts to generate more thorough content and ensure that it is well-suited for the student’s learning level.

## Becoming Production-Ready 

We're already seeing AI agents in action across various fields like customer service, travel, health and fitness, as well as education. However, for AI agents to be truly production-ready and widely adopted, we need to continue to improve their reliability and accuracy. 

This requires actively monitoring their decision making processes and gaining a deep understanding of how inputs influence outputs. The most effective way to achieve this is through robust monitoring tools that provide comprehensive insights to ensure AI agents consistently deliver optimal results.
