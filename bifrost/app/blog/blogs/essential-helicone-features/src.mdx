## Getting started: integrating with 1-line of code

Whether you're prototyping or maintaining a production app, Helicone's one-line integration lets you focus on building, not configuring.

### Integrating with any provider

Integrating Helicone with your AI app requires changing just a single line of code. The platform is compatible with various AI models and APIs - you can find the complete <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/gateway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of integrations</a> in our docs.

By simply updating the base URL, you can easily switch between different models like GPT-4 and LLaMA. Here's an example:

```python
# Before
baseURL = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

# Change the URL to use Helicone
baseURL = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"
```

## 1. Custom Properties to Segment Requests

Custom Properties helps you tailor the LLM analytics to your needs. Custom Properties lets you segment requests, allowing you to make more data-driven improvements and targeted optimizations.

In a nutshell,Custom Properties can be implemented using headers, and supports any type of custom metadata.

### How it works

1. Add custom headers to your requests using this format: `Helicone-Property-[Name]: [value]` where `Name`is the name of your custom property. For example:

   ```python
   headers = {
       "Helicone-Property-Session": "121",
       "Helicone-Property-App": "mobile",
       "Helicone-Property-Conversation": "support_issue_2"
   }
   ```

   More info about Custom Properties in the <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties" target="_blank">docs</a>.

2. Now you can segment incoming requests on the Dashboard, Requests, or Properties page. For example:

- Filter for specific prompt chains on <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/requests" target="_blank">Requests</a> page to analyze costs and latency.
  ![Filter by custom properties on Helicone's Request page](/static/blog/4-essential-features/request-page.webp)
- Analyze "unit economics" (e.g., average cost per conversation) on <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/properties" target="_blank">Properties</a> page.
  ![Analyze unit economics using custom properties in Helicone](/static/blog/4-essential-features/properties-page.webp)
- Filter for all requests that meet a criteria on <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/dashboard" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> page.

## 2. Sessions to Debug Complex Workflows

Helicone's Sessions feature allows developers to group and visualize multi-step LLM interactions, providing invaluable insights into complex AI workflows. This feature is available on all plans and is currently in beta.

In a nutshell, you can group related requests for a more holistic analysis. You can also track request flows across multiple traces.

### How it works

1. Add the following three headers to your requests.

   ```python
   headers = {
       "Helicone-Session-Id": session_uuid,  # The session id you want to track
       "Helicone-Session-Path": "/abstract",  # The path of the session
       "Helicone-Session-Name": "Course Plan"  # The name of the session
   }
   ```

2. Use the Helicone dashboard to visualize and analyze your sessions. For example:

- **Use case 1:** Reconstruct conversation flows or multi-stage tasks in the `Chat` view
  ![Reconstruct conversation flows or multi-stage in chat view](/static/blog/4-essential-features/convo-view.webp)
- **Use case 2:** Analyze performance across the entire interaction sequence in the `Tree` view
  ![Analyze performance across entire interaction sequences in tree view](/static/blog/4-essential-features/tree-view.webp)
- **Use case 3:** Identify bottlenecks in your AI workflows in the `Span` view
  ![Identify bottlenecks in your AI workflows in span view](/static/blog/4-essential-features/span-view.webp)
- **Use case 4:** Gain deeper insights into user behavior with conversation context.

### Applications

Imagine creating an AI app that creates a course outline.

```python
const session = randomUUID();

openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Generate an abstract for a course on space.",
      },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Session-Id": session,
      "Helicone-Session-Path": "/abstract",
      "Helicone-Session-Name": "Course Plan",
    },
  }
);
```

This setup allows you to track the entire course creation process, from abstract to detailed lessons, as a single session.

For developers working on applications with complex, multi-step AI interactions, Sessions provides a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing your AI workflows.

   ```python
   import { hpf } from "@helicone/prompts";

   ...

   content: hpf`Write a story about ${{ character }}`,
   ```

3. Assign a unique ID to your prompt using a header. Here's the doc on <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/prompts" target="_blank">Prompt Management & Experiments</a>. For example:

   ```python
   headers: {
     "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
   },
   ```

### Example implementation

```python
import { hpf } from "@helicone/prompts";

const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: hpf`Write a story about ${{ character }}`,
      },
    ],
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
    },
  }
);
```

       "Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3",
       "Helicone-Cache-Seed": "user-123"
   }
   ```

3. (optional) Extract cache status from response headers:

   ```python
   cache_hit = response.headers.get('Helicone-Cache')
   cache_bucket_idx = response.headers.get('Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Idx')
   ```

### Benefits

- Faster response times for common queries
- Reduced load on backend resources
- Lower costs by minimizing redundant LLM calls
- Insights into frequently accessed data

### Applications

Imagine you're building a customer support chatbot. With LLM Caching:

1. Common questions get instant responses from cache
2. You save on API costs for repetitive queries
3. Your app maintains consistent responses for similar inputs
4. You can analyze cache hits to identify popular topics

### Example implementation

```python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer <API_KEY>",
        "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",
        "Cache-Control": "max-age=2592000",
        "Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3",
    }
)

chat_completion_raw = client.chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world!"}]
)

cache_hit = chat_completion_raw.http_response.headers.get('Helicone-Cache')
print(f"Cache status: {cache_hit}")  # Will print "HIT" or "MISS"
```

LLM Caching provides a faster response time and valuable insights into usage patterns, allowing developers to further refine their AI systems.
