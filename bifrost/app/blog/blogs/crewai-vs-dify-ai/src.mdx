## What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is a multi-agent automation tool for building AI agentic workflows. CrewAI's
comprehensive tools **simplify the building, management, and deployment of AI agents**.

These agents are typically powered by large language models (LLMs) and can be
integrated with external tools to improve functionality.

![CrewAI - Open-source AI Agent Builder](/static/blog/crewai-vs-dify-ai/crewai.webp)

**CrewAI** allows developers to create role-based AI agents for defined workflows. Users can assign agent roles, goals, and backstories while specifying skill mappings, configuring interaction patterns, etc.

### Key Features

- Role-based schema for determining distinct roles for AI agents
- Supports multi-agent workflows
- Customizable framework that supports integration with LangChain and more.
- Built-in error handling and safety management

### Limitations

- Less robust at handling complex code execution compared to alternatives like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/crewai-vs-autogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AutoGen</a> from Microsoft
- Less suited for tasks that require heavy computation or are highly specialized
- Less flexibility than other developer-centric platforms

### Pricing

- **Free tier available for exploring limited features**
- Enterprise plans include templates, built-in access controls, and more.

## How to Build an AI Agent in CrewAI

**CrewAI** offers a structured approach to building AI agents.

CrewAI's CLI provides a streamlined way to scaffold and organize your agent projects. Install it by following the instructions in the <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installation guide</a>, then:

1. **Create a new crew project:**

   ```bash
   crewai create crew your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Define your agents in `agents.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   # src/your_project_name/config/agents.yaml
   researcher:
     role: >
       {topic} Senior Data Researcher
     goal: >
       Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
     backstory: >
       You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
       developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
       information and present it in a clear and concise manner.
   ```

   You can also define agents directly in Python code. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#creating-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official CrewAI documentation</a> for more details.

   _Note that the YAML approach is recommended, especially for larger projects._

3. **Define your tasks in `tasks.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   # src/your_project_name/config/tasks.yaml
   research_task:
     description: >
       Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
     expected_output: >
       A list with 10 bullet points of relevant information
     agent: researcher
   ```

4. **Implement your crew in `crew.py`:**

   ```python
   from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
   from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
   from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

   @CrewBase
   class YourProjectCrew():
    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
      return Agent(config=self.agents_config['researcher'], tools=[SerperDevTool()])

    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
      return Task(config=self.tasks_config['research_task'])

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
      return Crew(agents=self.agents, tasks=self.tasks, process=Process.sequential)
   ```

5. **Run your crew:**
   ```bash
   crewai install
   crewai run
   ```

## How to Build a Dify Agent

**Dify.AI** offers two primary methods for creating agents: using pre-built templates or building your own from scratch.

Both approaches leverage Dify's visual interface, requiring no coding.

#### Method 1: Start with a Dify Template

![Start with a Dify template - No-code AI Agent Builder](/static/blog/crewai-vs-dify-ai/dify-ai-templates.webp)

1. Log in to your **Dify.AI** dashboard
2. Navigate to the `Explore` section
3. Browse available templates (chatbots, assistants, etc.)
4. Select a template that matches your needs
5. Click "Use Template" to add it to your workspace
6. Customize the template parameters to fit your specific requirements
7. Test your agent in the preview mode
8. Deploy when ready

This method is ideal for quickly launching applications like content generators, or data analysis tools without starting from scratch.

#### Method 2: Build Your Own Custom **Dify Agent**

![Build your own custom Dify agent - No-code AI Agent Builder](/static/blog/crewai-vs-dify-ai/dify-ai-custom.webp)

{/* screenshot no longer fits */}

**Dify.AI** provides a dedicated "Agent" application type for creating intelligent assistants. Here's how to build one using Dify's intuitive interface:

1. **Navigate and Create:**

   - Go to Dify Studio → Create Application → Select "Agent"

2. **Configure Core Components:**

   - **Definition:** Set name and description
   - **Instructions:** Define skills, workflow, and limitations
   - **Tools:** Add knowledge bases, search capabilities, and API integrations
   - **Settings:** Choose inference model (Function Calling/ReAct) and parameters
   - **Conversation Opener:** Design initial user experience

3. **Test and Deploy:**
   - Debug using the testing interface
   - Refine instructions and configurations
   - Publish as a web app or API endpoint

<BottomLine
  title="Tip 💡"
  description="Dify supports various application types beyond agents, including Chatbots, Text Generators, Chatflows, and Workflows. Choose the application type that best matches your specific use case - Agents for autonomous reasoning and tool use, Chatbots for conversation, Text Generators for content creation, and Workflows for automation."
