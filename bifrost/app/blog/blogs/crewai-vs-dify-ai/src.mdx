## What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is a multi-agent automation tool for builing AI agentic workflows. CrewAI's
comprehensive tools **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>simplify building, managing, and deploying AI agents</span>**.
These agents are typically powered by large language models (LLMs) and can be
integrated with external tools to improve functionality.

![CrewAI - Open-source AI Agent Builder](/static/blog/crewai-vs-dify-ai/crewai.webp)

**CrewAI** allows developers to create role-based AI agents for defined workflows. Users can assign agent roles, goals, and backstories while specifying skill mappings, configuring interaction patterns, etc.

### Key Features

- Role-based schema for determining distinct roles for AI agents
- Supports multi-agent workflows
- Customizable framework that supports integration with LangChain and more.
- Built-in error handling and safety management

### Limitations

- Less robust at handling complex code execution compared to alternatives like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/crewai-vs-autogen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AutoGen</a>
- Less suited for tasks that require heavy computation or are highly specialized
- Less flexibility than other developer-centric platforms

### Pricing

- **Free tier available for exploring limited features**
- Enterprise plans includes templates, built-in access controls, and more.

_For up-to-date pricing information, we recommend checking <a href="https://www.crewai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrewAI's official website</a>._

### How to Build an AI Agent in CrewAI

To build a CrewAI agent, you can either use **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>YAML configuration</span>** (as CrewAI recommends) or **<span style={{color: '#03A9F4'}}>define them directly</span>** in code.

#### Example: YAML Configuration

```python
# src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: >
    {topic} Senior Data Researcher
  goal: >
    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: >
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: >
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

_For the method using direct definition, please refer to <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrewAI's documentation</a>._
