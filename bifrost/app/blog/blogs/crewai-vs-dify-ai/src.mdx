## How to Build an AI Agent in CrewAI

**CrewAI** offers a structured approach to building AI agents. 

CrewAI's CLI provides a streamlined way to scaffold and organize your agent projects. Install it by following the instructions in the <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installation guide</a>, then:

1. **Create a new crew project:**
   ```bash
   crewai create crew your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Define your agents in `agents.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   # src/your_project_name/config/agents.yaml
   researcher:
     role: >
       {topic} Senior Data Researcher
     goal: >
       Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
     backstory: >
       You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
       developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
       information and present it in a clear and concise manner.
   ```

   You can also define agents directly in Python code. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#creating-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official CrewAI documentation</a> for more details.

   *Note that the YAML approach is recommended, especially for larger projects.*

3. **Define your tasks in `tasks.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   # src/your_project_name/config/tasks.yaml
    research_task:
      description: >
        Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
      expected_output: >
        A list with 10 bullet points of relevant information
      agent: researcher
   ```

4. **Implement your crew in `crew.py`:**
   ```python
   from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
   from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
   from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

   @CrewBase
   class YourProjectCrew():
    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
      return Agent(config=self.agents_config['researcher'], tools=[SerperDevTool()])

    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
      return Task(config=self.tasks_config['research_task'])

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
      return Crew(agents=self.agents, tasks=self.tasks, process=Process.sequential)
   ```

5. **Run your crew:**
   ```bash
   crewai install
   crewai run
   ```

## How to Build a Dify Agent

**Dify.AI** offers two primary methods for creating agents: using pre-built templates or building your own from scratch. 

Both approaches leverage Dify's visual interface, requiring no coding.

#### Method 1: Start with a Dify Template

![Start with a Dify template - No-code AI Agent Builder](/static/blog/crewai-vs-dify-ai/dify-ai-templates.webp)

1. Log in to your **Dify.AI** dashboard
2. Navigate to the `Explore` section
3. Browse available templates (chatbots, assistants, etc.)
4. Select a template that matches your needs
5. Click "Use Template" to add it to your workspace
6. Customize the template parameters to fit your specific requirements
7. Test your agent in the preview mode
8. Deploy when ready

This method is ideal for quickly launching applications like content generators, or data analysis tools without starting from scratch.

#### Method 2: Build Your Own Custom **Dify Agent**
