## Why Look Beyond OpenRouter?

Let's be honest: OpenRouter is a great tool. It's simple to use, has a great UI, and routes you to any model using the OpenAI API.

However, as your AI application scales, you'll likely encounter these limitations:

**Cost Accumulation**: The 5% markup might seem small initially, but at scale it adds thousands to your monthly bill. On a $10,000/month LLM spend, that's an extra $500—money that could fund additional compute or features. At $100K/month, you're paying $5,000 just for routing.

**Limited Observability**: Basic activity logs don't provide the detailed metrics needed to optimize performance and debug issues in production. You can't track token usage per user, analyze latency distributions, or identify cost optimization opportunities.

**Not Open-Source**: Because their entire codebase is closed-source, we have no idea what information they are storing, how they're using it, or check for any potential security vulnerabilities.

If any of these limitations affect your application, it's time to evaluate alternatives.

## How to Choose the Best OpenRouter Alternative

Here are five key factors to consider:

**Cost Structure**: Does it charge markup fees, or does it offer pass-through billing? Are there hidden costs at scale? For high-volume applications, even small markups compound quickly.

**Observability**: What monitoring, logging, and debugging capabilities does it provide? Do you need detailed metrics to optimize costs and troubleshoot issues.

**Performance**: How much latency does it add? What's the routing intelligence? Do you need the cheapest option, or do you need the fastest available model?

**Deployment Flexibility**: Can you self-host? What infrastructure options are available? Self-hosting is often critical for compliance, cost control, and data sovereignty.

**Production Features**: Does it offer health monitoring, intelligent load-balancing, and distributed rate limiting?

Production deployments show Helicone processing 10,000+ requests/second with consistent 8ms P50 latency. The distributed architecture built on Cloudflare Workers, ClickHouse, and Kafka enables horizontal scaling without performance degradation.

Teams report 30-50% cache hit rates in production, translating to massive cost savings. One customer reduced their monthly LLM spend from $12,000 to $6,500 through intelligent caching and cost-optimized routing.

#### Getting Started with Helicone AI Gateway

Migrating from OpenRouter takes under 2 minutes:

**Step 1: Get your Helicone API key**
1. [Sign up for free](https://helicone.ai/signup) and complete onboarding
2. Generate your API key at [API Keys](https://us.helicone.ai/settings/api-keys)

**Step 2: Update your code**

```typescript
// TypeScript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
  apiKey: process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY,
});

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini", // Or 100+ other models
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello from Helicone!" }],
});
```

```python
# Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
    api_key=os.getenv("HELICONE_API_KEY")
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Helicone!"}]
)
```

That's it! Your requests now automatically route through Helicone with built-in observability, caching, and fallbacks. View your requests at [Helicone Dashboard](https://us.helicone.ai/requests).

**How Credits Work**: Instead of managing API keys for each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), Helicone maintains the keys for you. Simply add credits to your account with **0% markup**—you pay exactly what providers charge. Want more control? You can [bring your own provider keys](https://us.helicone.ai/providers) instead.

**Best For**: Production AI applications where cost efficiency, performance, and reliability matter. Teams that want OpenRouter's multi-provider convenience without the markup fees and with better observability.
