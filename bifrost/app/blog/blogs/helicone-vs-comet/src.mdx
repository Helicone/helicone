As your Large Language Model (LLM) application goes into production, you need reliable observability tools to track, debug, and optimize model performance.

Enter **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Opik</span>** (by Comet), two leading open-source LLM evaluation platforms, each offering unique capabilities tailored to different use cases.

This article compares their features, integrations, and strengths to help you determine which tool is the best fit for you.

## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone is easy to set up

Helicone's key strengths lie in its **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>extremely simple setup</span>** for the cloud offering, **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>built-in caching</span>**, and intuitive **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>prompt experimentation</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>evaluation</span>** features to optimize application performance.

Beyond the easy developer experience, we try to be as transparent as possible about <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our pricing</a>. You do not need to provide your credit card to try the free tier.

See our <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/llm-cost" rel="noopener" target="_blank">API Cost Calculator</a> for a rough estimate of how much you can save with different model providers.

### 2. Helicone is designed for teams

Helicone is a complete observability tool that **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>covers the full LLM lifecycle</span>**, from logging and experimentation to evaluation and deployment. Opik shares similar features as Helicone but requires more coding to use.

Helicone is more suited for cross-functional teams given the ability to have non-technical members involved in prompt design and evaluation.

| Feature                      | Helicone                                                                | Opik                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ease of Use                  | ⭐️ UI-driven, most actions require no coding                           | Requires more code for setup and use                              |
| Security & Compliance        | ⭐️ Built-in security features (i.e., Key Vault for API key management) | No security-focused features                                      |
| Evaluation & Scoring         | Very robust UI-driven evaluation tools                                  | ⭐️ Robust code-driven evaluation, with strong automation support |
| Cost Tracking & Optimization | ⭐️ Advanced cost analytics & caching for reducing API expenses         | Less cost-focused tools                                           |
| Integrations                 | ⭐️ Broad support for LLM providers & third-party tools                 | Fewer integrations                                                |
| Programming Language Support | ⭐️ Supports multiple languages without SDK requirement                 | Requires SDK for usage                                            |

## Which LLM evaluation platform should you choose?

Both platforms are excellent choices for monitoring and optimizing LLM applications. Here's a quick guide to help you decide:

- Choose **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone</span>** if you want a full observability suite with easy setup, caching, cost tracking, and security. It's ideal for **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>cross-functional teams</span>** that need a mix of no-code UI and developer-friendly tools.
- Choose **Opik** if you're mainly focused on AI evaluation and need robust automated scoring with fine-grained, code-based control.
- Choose **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone</span>** if your team includes non-technical members involved in building and managing the application.
- Choose **Opik** if you need a strong integration with the Comet ecosystem.

Both are **open-source** with free tiers—so you can try both and decide based on your workflow!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. Which platform is easier to set up?

Helicone is easier to integrate since it only requires adding headers to API calls. Opik, on the other hand, requires an SDK and more configuration to get started.

#### 2. Which platform has better cost tracking?

Helicone provides a centralized dashboard with detailed cost tracking and analysis. Opik offers basic cost tracking and lacks the same level of visualization.

#### 3. Which platform has better prompt management?

Both platforms support prompt versioning and tracking, but Helicone offers a more feature-rich playground with better UI-driven prompt experimentation.

#### 4. Which platform is better for evaluating LLM performance?

Both Helicone and Opik support human, automated, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations with custom evaluation metrics. However, Opik has better automated scoring, while Helicone allows integration with LastMile for fine-tuned evaluations.

#### 5. Does either platform support caching?

Yes, Helicone provides built-in caching to reduce API costs and latency. Opik does not offer caching.

#### 6. Which platform is better for large-scale integrations?

Helicone supports more integrations with third-party tools, orchestration frameworks, and model providers. Opik has fewer integrations.

#### 7. Which platform offers better security?

Helicone provides robust security features, including Key Vault for secure API key management and Prompt Armor for enhanced security. Opik has limited security features.
