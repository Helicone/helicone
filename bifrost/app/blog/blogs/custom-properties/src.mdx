## What are Custom Properties?

Custom Properties are metadata that you can attach to your LLM requests. In Helicone, you can tag your requests with specific information to create **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>detailed segments of your data</span>**, such as session/conversation/app IDs, the prompt chain or metadata about the user who made the request.

**In this blog, we'll explore:**

- the importance of custom properties, and how they enable a deeper understanding of user behavior, preferences, and patterns.
- how you can tailor your services for your customers to **drive business growth**.
- how companies like **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Journalist AI</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Greptile</span>** use custom properties for user analysis.

## Use Case 1: Environment Tracking

Tracking environments in Helicone allows you to monitor and differentiate between various operational stages such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`.

### Implementation

```python
client.chat.completions.create(
    # ...
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-Property-Environment": "development", # simply add this header to your request
    }
)
```

### Best for:

    - **Compare performance metrics** across different stages on Helicone's dashboard. Address any issues or performance bottlenecks before moving to production.
    - **Identify cost-saving opportunities** by tracking costs incurred at each stage, removing unnecessary expenses and optimizing resource usage.
    - **Collect early user feedback** from staging environments and compare across stages to track improvements and refine your product.

## Use Case 2: User and Feature Segmentation

Understanding user behavior patterns makes it easier to find opportunities to personalize marketing campaigns, introduce new features, or expand into new markets based on trends or demand patterns.

### 1. Geographic Location

    Monitoring how your application perform across different geographic regions.

    ```python
        headers={
            "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
            "Helicone-Property-Country": "USA", # simply add this header to your request
        }
    ```

            "Helicone-Property-Feature": "spellcheck", # simply add this header to your request
        }
    ```

    **Best for**:

    - Smartly optimizing development efforts
    - Prioritizing features with proven demands
    - Aligning development priorities with user needs and pain points

### 3. Plan Segments

    Implementing precise usage-based billing models by user types (free vs. premium).

        headers={
            "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
            "Helicone-Property-Plan": "enterprise", # simply add this header to your request
        }
    ```

    **Best for:**

    - Tracking user-specific metadata such as subscription plans, usage tiers, or subscription renewal dates
    - Identifying opportunities to upsell or cross-sell additional services
