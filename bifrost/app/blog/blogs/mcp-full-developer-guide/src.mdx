Anthropic's **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is gaining massive traction as a game-changing standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to external data sources and tools.

Let's take a deep dive into just exactly what MCP is, and how you can begin using it in your projects.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is an open protocol that **standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs**. 

Think of MCP like a "USB-C port for AI applications". Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to external data sources and tools.

### MCP Architecture

The protocol follows a client-server architecture with three main components:

1. **Hosts**: LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
2. **Clients**: Components within hosts that maintain connections with servers
3. **Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the protocol

![MCP Architecture](/static/blog/mcp-full-developer-guide/mcp-architecture.webp)

For example, in a workflow using Claude to analyze company sales data stored in a PostgreSQL database:

- The **host** is the Claude Desktop app
- The **client** is the MCP client module within Claude Desktop that manages connections to MCP servers 
- The **server** is the PostgreSQL MCP server that securely connects to the company database

For details, check out the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation</a>. 

### Why MCP Exists

Before MCP, developers had to build custom integrations from scratch whenever they wanted LLMs to access external systems (files, APIs, databases). 

Each implementation was different, required significant code, and wouldn't work with desktop apps. MCP provides a standardized framework for these integrations that works consistently across implementations, with a common communication protocol between systems and AI tools.

## Core Capabilities of MCP

MCP offers three primary capabilities:

1. **Resources**: File-like data that LLMs can read (API responses, file contents)
2. **Tools**: Functions that LLMs can call to perform actions
3. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks

<BottomLine
  title="What is the difference between MCP vs function calling? 💡"
  description="Function calling is how LLMs decide what code to run when you ask them to perform tasks. Every LLM provider implements function calling differently in their APIs. MCP creates a standardized layer that sits on top of function calling—it handles discovering available functions, executing them securely, and returning results consistently regardless of which LLM you're using."

## Getting Started with MCP

We will walk you through 3 implementation approaches to get started with MCP based on your needs and experience level.

- **Basic 🟢**: Using pre-built MCP servers with Claude Desktop
- **Intermediate 🟡**: Building custom MCP servers with Cloudflare Workers
- **Advanced 🔴**: Creating custom MCP clients and servers from scratch

### Basic Setup: Connecting Pre-built MCP Servers (🟢)

Let's set up a simple MCP configuration to access file system and web search capabilities with Claude Desktop.

#### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop

<a href="https://claude.ai/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download</a> and install Claude Desktop.

#### Step 2: Configure MCP Servers

Create or edit the configuration file at:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your_brave_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the configuration, restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

#### Step 4: Test Your Setup

Now you can ask Claude to use these tools:

- "Search the web for the latest news on Anthropic and save a summary to my documents folder."
- "List all files in my allowed files directory."

When Claude needs to use an MCP tool, it will request your permission before proceeding.

### Intermediate Setup: Building Custom MCP Servers with Cloudflare Workers (🟡)

Cloudflare Workers offer a simplified approach to building MCP servers. Let's create an image generation server:

#### Step 1: Set Up Cloudflare Worker and Configure to Support MCP

```bash
# Create a new Cloudflare project
npx create-cloudflare@latest mcp-imagegen
cd mcp-imagegen

# Install the workers-mcp package
npm install workers-mcp

# Configure to support MCP
npx workers-mcp setup
```

#### Step 2: Implement the Image Generation Server

Replace the content of `src/index.ts` with:

```typescript
import { WorkerEntrypoint } from 'cloudflare:workers'
import { ProxyToSelf } from 'workers-mcp'

export default class ImageGenerator extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
  /**
   * Generate an image using an AI model.
   * @param prompt {string} A text description of the image you want to generate.
   * @param steps {number} The number of diffusion steps; higher values can improve quality but take longer.
   * @return {string} URL to the generated image.
   */
  async generateImage(prompt: string, steps: number = 30): Promise<Response> {
    const response = await this.env.AI.run('@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-1-schnell', {
      prompt,
      steps,
    });
    
    // Convert from base64 string
    const binaryString = atob(response.image);
    // Create byte representation
    const img = Uint8Array.from(binaryString, (m) => m.codePointAt(0)!);
    
    return new Response(img, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg',
      },
    });
  }

  /**
   * @ignore
   */
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    return new ProxyToSelf(this).fetch(request)
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Your Worker

```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Step 4: Configure Claude Desktop (Optional)

To add your newly-created MCP to Claude Desktop for example, update your `claude_desktop_config.json` to include your Cloudflare Worker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "image-generator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["wrangler", "dev", "--local"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can ask Claude to generate images, and it will use your Cloudflare Worker to do so!

### Advanced Setup: Creating Custom MCP Clients (🔴)

Building an MCP client allows you to create a custom application to connect to MCP servers. For detailed instructions, visit <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Anthropic's official guide</a> to learn how to build a client in Python, NodeJS, or Java.

{/* ### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Create a new Python project
uv init mcp-client
cd mcp-client
# Create virtual environment
uv venv
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# Install required packages
uv add mcp anthropic python-dotenv
# Create our main file
touch client.py
```

### Step 2: Implement the Client

Create a simple client that connects to MCP servers and processes queries:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Optional
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

            raise ValueError("Server script must be a .py or .js file")
        
        command = "python" if is_python else "node"
        server_params = StdioServerParameters(
            command=command,
            args=[server_script_path],

        await self.session.initialize()
        
        # List available tools
        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        tools = response.tools
        print("\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in tools])

    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Process a query using Claude and available tools"""
        messages = [
            {

        print("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.")
        
        while True:
            try:
                query = input("\nQuery: ").strip()
                if query.lower() == 'quit':
                    break
                
                response = await self.process_query(query)

        print("Usage: python client.py <path_to_server_script>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    client = MCPClient()
    try:
        await client.connect_to_server(sys.argv[1])
        await client.chat_loop()
    finally:
        await client.cleanup()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Step 3: Run Your Client

To use your client with the image generation server we created earlier:

```bash
python client.py /path/to/weather/weather.py
```

You'll get an interactive chat interface where you can ask questions about the weather, and the client will use Claude to generate images and call the appropriate tools. */}

2. **Use Claude Desktop's Developer Tools** - Access Chrome DevTools within Claude Desktop to inspect client-side behavior, network requests, and console logs

3. **Analyse Logs** - View detailed logs generated by MCP servers and Claude Desktop to identify connection issues and runtime errors

4. **Use the MCP CLI** - Use command-line tools to inspect and test MCP servers and their capabilities

5. **Implement Server-Side Logging** - Implement custom logging in your MCP server to track execution flow, input validation, and error states

6. **Use Network Analysis Tools** - For HTTP-based MCP servers, use proxies and network analyzers to inspect the communication between clients and servers

7. **Perform Standalone Testing** - Test MCP servers in isolation before integrating them with clients to identify server-specific issues

8. **Environment Validation** - Verify that environment variables, file paths, and permissions are correctly configured
