Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been the gold standard for extending LLM knowledge beyond training cutoffs. But as context windows grow exponentially, a new approach is gaining traction: **Context-Augmented Generation (CAG)**.

![Implement and Monitor CAG with Helicone](/static/blog/implement-and-monitor-cag/cag-cover.webp)

Unlike RAG, which retrieves relevant chunks from a knowledge base, **CAG loads entire documents directly into the LLM's context window.** This simpler approach is now viable thanks to dramatically expanded context lengths, from just 4K tokens two years ago to 1-2 million tokens today.

Let's take a look at why this matters and how you can implement it in your LLM applications.

| Best For           | Massive datasets that exceed context windows                                                           | Documents that fit within context limits           |

**The key advantage of CAG is simplicity.** No complex chunking strategies, no vector database setup, and no worrying about whether you've retrieved the right information, because everything is there.

## What Makes CAG Now Possible?

### 1. Context Windows Expanded Massively

Modern flagship models have context windows orders of magnitude larger than before:

- 2022: ~4K tokens typical
- 2024: 100K-200K tokens common, with Gemini supporting up to 2M tokens

To put this in perspective, a 2M token context can fit:

- Two complete novels the length of _War and Peace_
- Thousands of pages of documentation
- Entire codebases

### 2. Retrieval Accuracy Improved Within Large Contexts

LLMs have become remarkably better at finding information in vast contexts. Google's "needle in a haystack" tests have shown models like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gemini-2.0-flash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini 2.0</a> achieving near-perfect recall of specific information in contexts up to 1M tokens.

### 3. Token Pricing is Now More Affordable

Input token costs have fallen dramatically, especially for models optimized for large contexts like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gemini-2.5-full-developer-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini 2.5</a> and <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gpt-4.1-full-developer-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4.1</a>.

## Building a CAG Application in Just 10 Lines of Code

The simplicity of CAG is its biggest selling point. Here's a complete implementation that lets you chat with any PDF document using Gemini 2.0 Flash:

```python
doc_url = "https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10089234/1/343019_3_art_0_py4t4l_convrt.pdf"

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=[
        types.Part.from_bytes(
            data=httpx.get(doc_url).content,
            mime_type='application/pdf',
        ),
        "Summarize this document"
    ]
)
```

That's it! Just 10 lines of code to:

1. Set a document URL
2. Download the PDF
3. Feed it directly to Gemini
4. Get a response

The key part is using `Part.from_bytes()` to convert the PDF directly into a format Gemini can process. No chunking, no vector database, no complex retrieval mechanisms, just direct document processing.

A similar implementation with RAG would require setting up embeddings, vector storage, chunking logic, and retrieval mechanisms, potentially hundreds of lines of code and multiple dependencies.

## Monitoring Your CAG Implementation

When using CAG, especially with large documents, monitoring becomes essential to track costs and optimize performance.

Helicone provides an easy way to add observability to your implementation by adding just a few lines of code.

For example, here's how you can add Helicone to your Gemini CAG implementation:

```python
client = genai.Client(
    api_key=os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'],
    http_options={
        "base_url": 'https://gateway.helicone.ai',
        "headers": {
            "helicone-auth": f'Bearer {os.environ.get("HELICONE_API_KEY")}',
            "helicone-target-url": 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com'
        }
    }
)

doc_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15605v1"  # Replace with the actual URL of your PDF

# Retrieve and encode the PDF bytes
filepath = pathlib.Path('file.pdf')
filepath.write_bytes(httpx.get(doc_url).content)
```

### Why should I integrate Helicone?

By adding the Helicone integration (which is just a few lines of code using the Proxy method), you get:

1. **Cost tracking**: See exactly how much each CAG query costs in real-time
2. **Response caching**: Cache identical CAG queries to avoid redundant costs
3. **Latency monitoring**: track how context size affects response time
4. **Custom properties**: segment by document type, size, or user queries

## When to Use CAG vs. RAG

While CAG is incredibly powerful, it's not a complete replacement for RAG. Here's when to use each approach:

| Choose CAG when...                                                              | Choose RAG when...                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Your entire knowledge base fits within context limits (typically < 1–2M tokens) | Your knowledge base is massive (many GB or TB of text)        |
| You need a simple, quick implementation with minimal maintenance                | You need to search across millions of documents               |
| You want highest possible retrieval accuracy                                    | You require advanced filtering by metadata, dates, categories |
| Your document set changes infrequently                                          | You need real-time updates to your knowledge base             |

### Hybrid Approaches

For larger datasets, consider these hybrid approaches:

1. **Filter, then use CAG.** Use traditional search or metadata filtering to select a subset of documents, then load them all into context.

2. **Parallel LLM calls.** Split large datasets into manageable chunks, process each with a separate LLM call, then have another LLM synthesize the results.

## Bottom Line

As LLM context windows continue to expand, CAG will likely become the default approach for many applications. We're already seeing several interesting developments:

1. **Context Caching**: Gemini and other models are introducing native "context caching," where you can store large contexts on the provider side and reference them in subsequent calls.

2. **Hybrid RAG-CAG Systems**: For truly massive datasets, systems that combine traditional search with CAG are emerging as the best solution.

3. **Multi-Model Architectures**: Using specialized models for different parts of the pipeline, like search, content filtering, and final generation.

The combination of larger context windows, improved retrieval accuracy, and greater simplicity has made CAG not just viable but potentially preferable to traditional RAG approaches.

As you explore CAG for your own applications, be sure to monitor your LLMs with tools like Helicone to ensure you're getting the most out of this powerful approach.
