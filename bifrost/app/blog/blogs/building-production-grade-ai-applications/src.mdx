## The Three Layers of an LLM Stack

The shift from AI prototypes to production-ready applications requires a robust tech stack that spans three critical layers: **inference, observability, and testing/experimentation**. 

Each layer serves a distinct purpose and demands specific tools to deliver reliable, scalable AI systems.

![LLM Stack Architecture](/static/blog/llm-stack-guide/llm-architecture.webp)

### 1. Inference Layer

The inference layer handles the actual execution of LLM requests, managing model deployments, and load balancing. It forms the foundation of your AI application's performance and reliability.

Key components include:

- **Model Providers**: Services that host LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **API Providers**: Platforms offering optimized access to multiple models
- **Gateways**: Services that manage rate limiting, routing, and caching
- **Load Balancers**: Tools that distribute traffic across multiple models

For a comprehensive comparison of inference providers, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/llm-api-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 11 LLM API Providers in 2025</a>.

### 2. Observability Layer

The observability layer provides insights into your AI application's behavior, performance, and costs. It's crucial for debugging, optimization, and monitoring production systems.

Key components include:

- **Request/Response Logging**: Capturing all LLM interactions
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitoring token usage and expenditures
- **Performance Metrics**: Measuring latency, throughput, and quality
- **Tracing**: Following requests through complex multi-step workflows

Helicone specializes in this layer, offering comprehensive visibility into your LLM applications with minimal integration effort.

## When to Build vs. Buy?

With all the tools and frameworks laid out, the question of whether to build custom components or leverage existing solutions comes to mind. Consider these factors:

- **Time constraints**: Commercial solutions offer faster time-to-market
- **Team expertise**: Custom development requires specialized skills
- **Specific requirements**: Unique needs may require custom solutions
- **Budget**: Consider both upfront and maintenance costs

For most teams, a hybrid approach works best: buy core infrastructure components like observability while building application-specific logic.

  },
  {
    question: "What are the key differences between agent frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, and LangChain?",
    answer: "CrewAI excels at role-based agent systems with defined workflows, making it ideal for sequential, predetermined tasks. AutoGen provides better support for dynamic, conversational problem-solving and robust code execution. LangChain offers a modular architecture with extensive integrations, while LlamaIndex specializes in efficient data retrieval. The best choice depends on your specific use case and technical requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Model Context Protocol (MCP) and why is it important?",
    answer: "Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface for connecting AI models to external tools, APIs, and data sources. Developed by Anthropic and adopted by major providers like Google and OpenAI, MCP allows AI applications to access external capabilities through a consistent framework. This standardization simplifies integration and enables more powerful agent capabilities without requiring custom code for each new tool or data source."
  },
  {
    question: "How should I monitor my LLM application in production?",
    answer: "Effective LLM monitoring requires tracking several key metrics: costs (token usage and total spend), performance (response times and throughput), quality (error rates and user feedback), and usage patterns (request volume and peak times). Tools like Helicone provide comprehensive monitoring with minimal setup, allowing you to identify issues, optimize costs, and maintain reliability. For complex applications, consider implementing tracing to follow requests through multi-step workflows."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I build custom components versus using existing solutions?",
    answer: "Consider building custom components when you have highly specific requirements, unique constraints, or need deep integration with proprietary systems. Choose existing solutions when time-to-market is critical, your team lacks specialized expertise, or the component is not a core differentiator for your application. For most teams, a hybrid approach works best: buy infrastructure components like observability platforms while building application-specific logic."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the most important security considerations for production AI applications?",
    answer: "Key security considerations include: 1) Implementing prompt injection countermeasures to prevent manipulation, 2) Ensuring data privacy through proper encryption and access controls, 3) Setting appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse, 4) Validating inputs and outputs to maintain application integrity, and 5) Monitoring for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues. For regulated industries, also consider compliance requirements related to AI system transparency and explainability."
