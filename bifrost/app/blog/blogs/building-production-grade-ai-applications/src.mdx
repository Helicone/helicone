### Setting Up Monitoring for Production

For OpenAI applications, adding Helicone monitoring takes just one line of code:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    default_headers={"Helicone-Auth": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
```

For local LLM deployments, [monitoring requires a custom proxy](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/monitoring-local-llms) that sits between your interface and model:

```bash
# Example Docker command to run a monitoring proxy for Ollama
docker run -d -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HELICONE_API_KEY=your_key \
  -e OLLAMA_HOST=http://host.docker.internal:11434 \
  helicone/ollama-proxy
```

## Prompt Engineering & Evaluation

Effective prompt engineering is the difference between mediocre and exceptional AI application performance.

### Key Prompting Techniques

1. **Chain-of-Thought**: Breaking down complex tasks into logical steps

```
Solve this step-by-step:
If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, who then buys 3 more apples and gives 1 back to John, how many apples do John and Mary each have?
```

2. **Few-Shot Learning**: Providing examples to guide the model

```
Classify the sentiment (positive/negative):

Input: "The movie was terrible and boring."
Output: negative

Input: "I loved the restaurant's atmosphere."
Output: positive

Input: "The hotel room was small but clean."
Output:
```

3. **Structured Outputs**: Using formats like JSON to ensure consistent responses

```python
# Using OpenAI's structured outputs
response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[...],
    response_format=ChatbotResponse  # Pydantic model
)
```

For a comprehensive guide, see our article on [prompt engineering tools and techniques](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools).

### A/B Testing Prompts in Production

Once your application is live, continuous improvement through testing is essential:

```python
# Using Helicone's experiments for A/B testing
from helicone.openai_async import openai
import helicone

helicone.api_key = "your-helicone-key"

experiment = helicone.experiment(
    name="customer-service-prompts",
    variants=[
        {"name": "detailed", "prompt": "Provide a detailed and thorough response..."},
        {"name": "concise", "prompt": "Provide a brief, direct response..."}
    ]
)

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": experiment.get_variant()}]
)
```

This allows you to measure which prompts perform better based on user feedback, completion times, or custom metrics.

## Protocols & Standards

As AI development matures, new standards are emerging to improve interoperability and integration.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

[Model Context Protocol](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/mcp-full-developer-guide) standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs:

```python
# Basic MCP server setup
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def connect_to_server(server_script_path: str):
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=[server_script_path],
        env=None
    )
    
    stdio_transport = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
    stdio, write = stdio_transport
    session = await exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(stdio, write))
    await session.initialize()
```

MCP enables standardized connections to databases, APIs, and other tools, working with models like Claude and soon OpenAI's models as well.

### OpenAI Structured Outputs

For ensuring consistent output formats, [OpenAI's Structured Outputs](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-structured-outputs) feature enforces schema-compliant responses:

```python
# Flight search chatbot example
response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[...],
    response_format=ChatbotResponse  # Pydantic model defining the structure
)

# The response will strictly conform to the ChatbotResponse schema
```

This ensures reliable integration with downstream systems that expect specific data structures.
