## The Three Layers of an LLM Stack

The shift from AI prototypes to production-ready applications requires a robust tech stack that spans three critical layers: **inference, observability, and testing/experimentation**.

Each layer serves a distinct purpose and demands specific tools to deliver reliable, scalable AI systems.

![LLM Stack Architecture](/static/blog/llm-stack-guide/llm-architecture.webp)

### 1. Inference Layer

The inference layer handles the actual execution of LLM requests, managing model deployments, and load balancing. It forms the foundation of your AI application's performance and reliability.

Key components include:

- **Model Providers**: Services that host LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **API Providers**: Platforms offering optimized access to multiple models
- **Gateways**: Services that manage rate limiting, routing, and caching
- **Load Balancers**: Tools that distribute traffic across multiple models

For a comprehensive comparison of inference providers, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/llm-api-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 11 LLM API Providers in 2025</a>.

### 2. Observability Layer

The observability layer provides insights into your AI application's behavior, performance, and costs. It's crucial for debugging, optimization, and monitoring production systems.

Key components include:

- **Request/Response Logging**: Capturing all LLM interactions
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitoring token usage and expenditures
- **Performance Metrics**: Measuring latency, throughput, and quality
- **Tracing**: Following requests through complex multi-step workflows

Helicone specializes in this layer, offering comprehensive visibility into your LLM applications with minimal integration effort.

- Implement <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt injection countermeasures</a>
- Use <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caching strategies</a> to reduce costs
- Apply <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-rate-limits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rate limits</a> to prevent unexpected billing spikes

These practices help maintain security while keeping costs predictable.

From comprehensive cost-tracking to integration with dedicated security tools like <a href="https://www.promptarmor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PromptArmor</a> and features like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/vault-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Vault</a>, Helicone provides robust tools for securing your AI applications both during development and in production as well as managing costs.

## When to Build vs. Buy?

With all the tools and frameworks laid out, the question of whether to build custom components or leverage existing solutions comes to mind. Consider these factors:

- **Time constraints**: Commercial solutions offer faster time-to-market
- **Team expertise**: Custom development requires specialized skills
- **Specific requirements**: Unique needs may require custom solutions
- **Budget**: Consider both upfront and maintenance costs

For most teams, a hybrid approach works best: buy core infrastructure components like observability while building application-specific logic.

Read our <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/buy-vs-build-llm-observability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comprehensive guide to the buy vs build debate</a> for more on this topic.

## Emerging Trends and Future Directions

The AI tooling landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Key trends to watch include:

- **Interoperability standards**: Increasing adoption of protocols like MCP
- **Local LLMs**: More people are running AI models locally, and with <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/monitoring-local-llms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robust monitoring</a>
- **Fine-tuning automation**: Simplified workflows for model customization
- **Hybrid architectures**: Combining proprietary and open-source models

Staying informed of these trends helps ensure your AI applications remain competitive and effective.

## Conclusion

Building production-grade AI applications requires a thoughtful approach to each layer of the tech stack. By selecting the right tools, implementing best practices, and establishing comprehensive monitoring, you can create reliable, scalable AI systems that deliver real business value.

The field continues to evolve rapidly, but the fundamental principles of good engineering—observability, testing, and robust infrastructure—remain essential for success.
