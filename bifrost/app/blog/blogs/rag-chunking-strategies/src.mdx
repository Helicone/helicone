Chunking strategies are fundamental to building production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. With RAG being increasingly adopted in AI-powered applications for providing contextually rich and accurate responses, optimizing how data is divided into manageable "chunks" is more critical than ever.

![RAG chunking strategies](/static/blog/rag-chunking-strategies/cover.webp)

Traditional chunking methods like **fixed-size chunking** have become outdated in modern RAG systems, largely due to their rigid approach that breaks text at arbitrary points and loses critical context.

In this guide, we will explore the most impactful chunking strategies, focusing on **Semantic Chunking** and **Agentic Chunking**, and include code examples to make these strategies actionable.

## What is Chunking in the Context of RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that improves the output of large language models by drawing relevant context from external knowledge bases. Central to the success of RAG applications is effective **chunking strategies**.

Chunking refers to dividing large datasets into smaller, meaningful pieces to improve retrieval from external knowledge bases. In the context of RAG, chunking makes sure that relevant information is indexed, retrieved, and integrated into the responses generated by LLMs.

The choice of chunking strategy impacts:

- Retrieval speed - How quickly relevant chunks are fetched.
- Accuracy - How contextually accurate the response is.
- Scalability - Performance on larger datasets.

## Why is Chunking Important for RAG?

### Improved efficiency

Chunking enables RAG systems to process large datasets more effectively by breaking them into smaller pieces. The smaller chunks means faster retrieval time and more efficient use of memory. As the volume of unstructured data continue to grow, developers need more intelligent segmentation strategies.

### Better accuracy

User queries are becoming more complex. Dividing text into smaller, meaningful chunks allows the retrieval component to identify and extract only the most relevant information, improve search precision and more accurate outputs.

### More scalable with token optimization

Chunking can reduce the number of input tokens passed to language models. LLMs have context window limitations and often charge based on token usage. By chunking efficiently, developers can cut costs and allow it to handle larger documents.

## What is Semantic Chunking for RAG?

Semantic chunking organizes information based on meaning rather than arbitrary breaks like paragraphs or sentences. The strategy was original introduced by as first introduced by Greg Kamradt.

By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, semantic chunking ensures each chunk represents a cohesive idea or topic.

### Advantages of Semantic Chunking

- Preserves contextual integrity of information - each chunk is a self-contained segment.
- Improves retrieval accuracy and relevancy - each fetched information is now tailed to the query‚Äôs intent

### Disadvantages of Semantic Chunking

- Computationally intensive and potentially slower
- May not consistently outperform simpler methods
- Can struggle with structured content like lists and headers

### Example Python Code for Semantic Chunking

Here‚Äôs a Python implementation using spaCy for semantic chunking:

```python
import spacy
# Load the spaCy language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
def semantic_chunking(text, max_length=50):
    """
    Splits text into semantic chunks using spaCy.
    Each chunk will have at most `max_length` words.
    """
    doc = nlp(text)
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    for sent in doc.sents:
        words = len(current_chunk) + len(sent.text.split())
        if words <= max_length:
            current_chunk.append(sent.text)
        else:
            chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [sent.text]
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(" ".join(current_chunk))

    return chunks
# Example Usage
text = """Chunking is a crucial step in RAG systems. It involves splitting large
datasets into smaller, meaningful parts to improve retrieval and response quality."""
chunks = semantic_chunking(text)
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks, 1):
    print(f"Chunk {i}: {chunk}")
```

## What is Agentic Chunking for RAG?

Agentic chunking incorporates user behavior and intent into chunking strategies. Instead of purely focusing on the structure of the data, agentic chunking adapts to how users interact with and query the system.

### Advantages of Agentic Chunking

- **Improved Relevance:** Tailors chunks to user behavior, enhancing retrieval quality.
- **Real-Time Adaptability:** Responds dynamically to changing user needs.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Provides faster and more accurate results.

### Disadvantages of Agentic Chunking

- **Complexity:** Requires more sophisticated algorithms and data structures.
- **Resource Intensive:** May not be as efficient as simpler methods.
- **Data Dependency:** Relies heavily on user behavior and retrieval feedback.

### Example Python Code for Agentic Chunking

Here‚Äôs a code snippet that demonstrates a behavior-driven chunk prioritization strategy:

```python
import pandas as pd
# Example dataset: user queries and associated document sections
data = [
    {"query": "What is RAG?", "section": "Introduction to RAG"},
    {"query": "Benefits of RAG", "section": "RAG Benefits and Use Cases"},
    {"query": "How does chunking work?", "section": "Chunking in RAG Systems"}
]
# Convert data to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
def prioritize_chunks(queries, sections):
    """
    Prioritize chunks based on query relevance.
    """
    chunk_score = {}
    for query in queries:
        for section in sections:
            # Simplified scoring: counting overlapping keywords
            score = len(set(query.lower().split()) & set(section.lower().split()))
            chunk_score[section] = chunk_score.get(section, 0) + score

    # Sort chunks by relevance score
    return sorted(chunk_score.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
# Example usage
queries = df['query']
sections = df['section']
prioritized_chunks = prioritize_chunks(queries, sections)
print("Prioritized Chunks:")
for section, score in prioritized_chunks:
    print(f"{section}: {score}")
```

## Traditional Chunking Techniques & Limitations

### Fixed-Size Chunking

Fixed-size chunking is the most common and straightforward approach. The technique involves splitting text into fixed character or token lengths. It‚Äôs computationally cheap and simple to implement. Fixed-size chunking works well for uniform datasets but lacks adaptability.

#### What are the limitations of fixed-size chunking?

- Disruptive sentence or word breaks. Can result in lost context and an increased probability of out-of-context information
- Lacks semantic awareness, can group unrelated material or separating related content
- Unsuitable for texts of varying structure or inconsistent formats

#### Example

```python
text = "Fixed-size chunking is simple and effective for uniform data."
chunk_size = 30
chunks = [text[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]
print("Fixed-Size Chunks:", chunks)
```

### Hierarchical Chunking

#### What are the benefits of hierarchical chunking?

- Captures both granular and high-level insights.
- Improves flexibility for diverse tasks.

Combines smaller chunks into larger ones to capture broader context.
Ideal for multi-level document processing.

#### Example

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
text = """
Hierarchical Chunking processes at different levels. Start with sentences and group into paragraphs.
"""
# Sentence-level splitting
sentence_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=50, chunk_overlap=0
)
sentence_chunks = sentence_splitter.split_text(text)
# Group sentences into larger chunks
hierarchical_chunks = [" ".join(sentence_chunks[i:i+2]) for i in range(0, len(sentence_chunks), 2)]
print("Hierarchical Chunks:", hierarchical_chunks)
```
