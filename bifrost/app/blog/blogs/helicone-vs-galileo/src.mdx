## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone is open-source and self-hostable

Helicone is <a href="https://github.com/Helicone/helicone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely open-source</a>, allowing you full control over your data and implementation. Companies can <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/self-host/overview#self-hosting-helicone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-host</a> Helicone within their infrastructure, ensuring flexibility and customization tailored to specific business needs.

While Galileo offers on-premises deployment for enterprise clients, its core platform remains proprietary. Being able to inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase gives Helicone users a deep level of transparency and control.

### 2. Helicone offers flexible deployment options

Helicone provides multiple integration methods:

- **Proxy-based**: Simply change your base URL for a <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/quick-start#quick-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-line integration</a>
- **Async logging**: Use Helicone's SDK for background logging without affecting request flow

This flexibility makes Helicone adaptable to various architectural needs. Galileo primarily uses an SDK-based approach, which requires more code changes throughout your application.

### 3. Helicone has a friendlier pricing model

Helicone offers a generous <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free tier</a> with 10k free requests/month. This allows you to get started with Helicone without any upfront costs. 

Helicone also offers Pro, Team, and Enterprise tiers with transparent pricing, catering to businesses of all sizes.

Galileo offers a limited free tier with 5,000 traces/month and jumps to Enterprise pricing after that, making it more expensive for smaller teams.
