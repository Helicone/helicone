## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone is open-source and self-hostable

Helicone is completely open-source, allowing you full control over your data and implementation. Companies can self-host Helicone within their infrastructure, ensuring flexibility and customization tailored to specific business needs.

While Galileo offers on-premises deployment for enterprise clients, its core platform remains proprietary. Being able to inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase gives Helicone users a level of transparency and control that Galileo can't match.

### 2. Helicone offers flexible deployment options

Helicone provides multiple integration methods:

- **Proxy-based**: Simply change your base URL for a one-line integration
- **Async logging**: Use Helicone's SDK for background logging without affecting request flow

This flexibility makes Helicone adaptable to various architectural needs. Galileo primarily uses an SDK-based approach, which requires more code changes throughout your application.

### 3. Helicone has a friendlier pricing model

Helicone offers a generous free tier with 10k free requests/month. This allows you to get started with Helicone without any upfront costs. 

Helicone also offers Pro, Team, and Enterprise tiers with transparent pricing‚Äîcatering to businesses of all sizes.

Galileo offers a limited free tier with 5,000 traces/month and jumps to Enterprise pricing after that, making it more expensive for smaller teams.
