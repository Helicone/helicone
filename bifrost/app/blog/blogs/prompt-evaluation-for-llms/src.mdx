### AI Agents ‚Äî Hype vs. Reality

For some, AI agents are groundbreaking ways to solve big problems by **breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks**. AI Agents are particularly great at handling repetitive or complex work. Critics, on the other hand, often imagine **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>‚ÄúSuper Agents‚Äù</span>** that could fully replace humans‚Äîbut we're not quite there yet.

However, this doesn't mean that AI agents aren‚Äôt incredibly useful today. Many platforms are already making meaningful strides in building robust, practical AI agents that empower teams, streamline processes, and unlock new possibilities across industries.

Today, we are covering our favorite **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>open-source frameworks & platforms for building AI agents, how they compare, and our recommendations for different use cases</span>** ‚Äî whether you need complex multi-agent systems or a simple no-code solution, these will help you get started.

## First, what are AI agents anyway?

**An AI agent is a software tool designed to handle tasks autonomously**. It observes its environment, makes decisions based on data, and takes action to achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention. Think of it as your code working smarter ‚Äî automating processes, analyzing data, and scaling seamlessly alongside your application

AI agents can handle a variety of tasks in enterprise software:

‚úÖ¬†Automate repetitive tasks to save time and manual work

‚úÖ¬†Analyze data and identify patterns quickly

‚úÖ¬†Operate 24/7 with no downtime

‚úÖ¬†Scale with your app and adapting to increased demand.

‚úÖ¬†Maintain consistent performance

## Some real-life examples

**Customer support bots**

Platforms like **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>ChatGPT</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Zendesk</span>**'s answer bot handle customer inquiries, provide instant support, and can often resolve issues without human intervention.

**Code completion agents**

Tools such as **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>GitHub Copilot</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Cursor</span>** suggest code completions, generate functions from natural language descriptions, and explain complex code segments, significantly boosting programmer productivity.

**AI research agents**

Platforms like **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Perplexity</span>** and **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Elicit</span>** process vast amounts of information, summarize academic papers, answer complex questions, and even generate hypotheses, changing how researchers approach information gathering and analysis.
