## Background

We finally decided to launch on Product Hunt after 1.5 years of building Helicone. With zero Product Hunt launch experience, our team managed to get **#1 Product of the Day** by focusing on **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>creative ways to activate our audience</span>**. 

A week before our launch, Stefan tweeted as a joke that for every upvote Helicone gets, he‚Äôs going to do a pushup. Turns out our whole team wants to join in on the suffering. We also handed out cookies in San Francisco and connected with all of our customers. 

We didn‚Äôt know what we were doing, but hopefully this will either inspire you or be a fun read.

## A Rollercoaster Ride

![Screenshot 2024-08-26 at 4.14.20‚ÄØPM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a52c5bf5-6c47-4523-8078-f7499ee1ba0b/c6e151e5-e73d-4f37-9f60-63fca9fb6f46/Screenshot_2024-08-26_at_4.14.20_PM.png)

Our votes got slashed by 200 throughout the day (due to bot upvotes which we didn't expect). Our biggest hit was around 8pm pst while our team went for dinner. Justin (Helicone‚Äôs CEO) documented [what happened that day](https://x.com/justinstorre/status/1826875803528839243) on X and how we reclaimed #1. 

We highly recommend monitoring the upvotes on [hunted.space](http://hunted.space) on launch day. It helped us to know when to relax, when to push harder etc.



### Preparation

- having a solid profile mattered, but not as much as warming up our audience weeks leading up to the launch.
    - **data**: Cole spend countless of hours creating a killer demo video, only for it to get 33 views. To put things into perspective, we got close to 800 upvotes at the end of launch day. Most of our support came from our distribution channels.
- strategizing around our objective ‚Äî for us, it‚Äôs exposure and user conversion. Getting #1 product of the day was a nice-to-have.
    - conversion:
        - PH launch was a great opportunity to convert some of our free users to the Growth plan. We offered a launch promo and notified our users about it through all channels ‚Äî email, landing page, in product, and social media.
    - exposure:
        - ‚Äúhow can we maximize exposure with the limited time we have‚Äù
        - The push-up idea was just for fun (a marketing stunt). We ended up doing 300 pushups altogether at the Salesforce park and got some attention. We recorded them and shared it on our personal X/Linkedin accounts (as they get more exposure than company accounts). We also gave out cookies in our office and designed a poster for our office‚Äôs elevator (they called it elevator pitch).




## What worked

- being super responsive in the comments, finding a way to talk about our advantage in the response, and respond in a way that gets our customers to continue interacting / comment back.
- Reaching out to everyone in our building
- Building momentum throughout the day (we were #4 at 7am, our starting votes were fewer but our growth was faster than companies launching on the same day.)
- Treating PH launch as team bonding ‚Äî team pushups, tweeting progress throughout, having fun with it.
- Speaking at events leading up to the launch.

## What can be improved

- Automating outreach for Linkedin and X
- Emailing our users earlier in the morning (like 8am) ‚Äî we emailed around noon so the open rate was not high.
- Finding a way to push a little harder from 12am-4am
- Setting up drips throughout the day (via email / LinkedIn) ‚Äî companies with launch experience do this.

## Our experience

Most people will tell you the initial 4 hours (between 12:01am - 4am) matter most as it sets the ranking. We didn‚Äôt invest too heavily in this. At 6am, we were fluctuating between #3 and #4. The gap between us and #2 was increasing so we thought that if we get #3, we‚Äôd be content. 

Throughout the day, we started getting more traffic. Our team took a detour to our office‚Äôs basement and the Salesforce park to do as many pushups as the number of upvotes we got. We recorded them and posted them on the social media. It was so silly but a lot of fun. That got some of our friends and customers invested. We saw a closing gap between us (#3) and #2. It gave us hope that maybe, just maybe we can reach #2. #2 was only 10-20 votes from #1. If we can get #2, we can try for #1 too. 

## Unexpected surprise

- the amount of support from our existing customers
- the surprising number of people we talked to that said ‚Äúhey I know Helicone‚Äù
- Unexpectedly meeting other startup founders just by talking to strangers.
- Meeting very genuine people who are not in tech but just wanted to help out
- the amount of connections our team was able to reach at the last hours of launch.
    - we thought we ran out of reserve, but going back to ‚Äúmaximizing exposure‚Äù, we got creative and was able to reclaim #1 from #3 in the last 3 hours.



## Measuring the results

- before product hunt launch, we had a consistent 10-15 user signup each day.
- on launch day and the day after, we had 50-60 sign ups.
- we also 3x‚Äôed user conversion from free plan to Growth plan.

## Learnings

- how creative our team can get with such a limited time
- how well our team worked together under pressure
- PH is a really good test to actually go out there and talk to people who might be your ICP, and see if they‚Äôd understand your pitch in the time it takes for them to choose a cookie.
- get good quality cookies!
- monitor your upvotes on [hunted.space](http://hunted.space). In case you experience a significant drop due to bots like we did, you can hop on damage control on time.

## Our team doing damage control at 11pm after 200 votes were slashed



In general, people were very willing to support. In terms of conversion, it was worth it for a day of work for the team, and a month of passive preparation ‚Äî one person on your team could likely spearhead this. If anything, we treated this more as a team bonding activity, a chance for the whole team to tell our network about the awesome product we‚Äôve been building, and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone (by either talking to strangers or through cold messaging) to see what‚Äôs possible. The best surprises after all, are the ones that come from ourselves. 

Good luck on your launch! We‚Äôd love to learn about your experience, and let us know if we can help in any way. üßäü§ó
