# The Introduction of OpenAI o1

## What changed from o1-preview?

- OpenAI o1 now supports image uploads, which wasn’t possible with o1-preview.
- O1 is more concise in its thinking, and major errors are reduced. O1 outperforms o1-preview by 34% on difficult real-world questions based on OpenAI’s tests.
- O1 is _replacing o1-preview_ in ChatGPT, which was initially released in September 2024. _**Plus and Team users will get access today**_ (upon release), while enterprise and education users will have access in a week.
- OpenAI is working on adding support for tools like web browsing in o1.

## How does o1 compare to previous models?

- O1 is more concise, powerful and provides better reasoning in general.
- In Math, o1 achieves an impressive 83% accuracy in the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMC) qualifying exam, vastly outperforming GPT-4o which only managed 13%.
- O1 model series significantly outperforms the GPT-4o models on safety benchmarks, such as jailbreak, adherence to content guidelines, according to [this paper on OpenAI o1 System Card](https://www.openread.academy/en/paper/reading?corpusId=514741749).
- O1 model is better able to following instructions, where it can prioritize privileged instructions over user or developer messages.

## Is OpenAI o1 available in the API?

O1 support will be available in the API, bringing a range of powerful new features. Developers can look forward to the addition of support for function calling, enhanced messaging capabilities, image analysis, web browsing, and file upload in the coming months. Additionally, OpenAI is preparing to introduce Structured Outputs and vision capabilities in the near future.

# New Plan: What is ChatGPT _Pro_?

**ChatGPT Pro** is OpenAI's new premium subscription tier for ChatGPT, launched on December 5 2024. Here’s a tl;dr:

- It costs $200 per month — 10x the cost of ChatGPT _Plus_.
- **You get unlimited usage.** No more daily time limits.
- You get unlimited access to all of OpenAI's models. This includes _o1 pro mode_ — a more powerful version of OpenAI o1, o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice — the human-like conversational feature.

## What is O1 Pro Mode?

OpenAI’s o1 pro mode is exclusive for ChatGPT _Pro_ users. It’s a version of o1 that uses more compute to think harder and provide more refined and insightful responses to complex problems in areas like data science, programming, and legal analysis.

To accommodate the longer response times associated with o1 pro mode, users will see a progress bar indicating wait times and receive notifications when tasks are completed.O1 pro performs better on challenging ML benchmarks (75% reduction in errors for easier coding competition questions).

## Who is it for?

ChatGPT Pro is aimed at researchers, engineers, and professionals who require advanced AI capabilities daily. Compared to other ChatGPT plans, it is significantly more expensive than ChatGPT Plus ($20/month).

> We think the audience for ChatGPT Pro will be the power users of ChatGPT — those who are already pushing the models to the limits of their capabilities on tasks like math, programming, and writing,

_- Jason Wei, a member of OpenAI’s technical staff, said during a livestreamed press conference._

## How much is ChatGPT Pro?

ChatGPT Pro is $200/month.

## ChatGPT _Pro_ vs. ChatGPT _Plus_ - what should you pick?

## Do you need a ChatGPT Pro subscription for o1?

No, all paid ChatGPT users (_Plus_ and _Pro_) can access o1 though the ChatGPT model selector. ChatGPT _Pro_ subscribers will get a better version of o1 (called o1 pro mode) that uses more compute, but it would take longer to generate responses.

## What’s next?

OpenAI has ambitious plans for its o1 reasoning model and the newly introduced ChatGPT Pro subscription plan. OpenAI intends to continuously improve the o1 model over time, including adding function calling capability, adding web browsing, file uploads and other performance improvements.

For the _Pro_ plan, OpenAI is planning to introduce more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features. For developers, O1 support will be available in the API with support for function calling, developer messages, structured outputs, vision and more.

Additionally, OpenAI has initiated a grant program through which 10 grants of ChatGPT _Pro_ will be awarded to medical researchers at leading institutions.

## What to expect in 2025

Based on recent developments, there are reports about OpenAI's plans to increase the price of ChatGPT Plus over the next few years. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- OpenAI currently charges $20 per month for ChatGPT _Plus_.
- Over the next five years, OpenAI intends to "aggressively raise" the cost of ChatGPT Plus, it is expected to reach $44 per month by 2029, according to [a report by New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html).
