- o1 is more concise, powerful, and provides better reasoning in general.
- In Math, <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/" target="_blank">o1 achieved an impressive 83% accuracy</a> on the 2024 AIME exams, designed to challenge the brightest students in the US, while GPT-4o only solved on average 12% of problems.
- o1 model series significantly outperforms the GPT-4o models on safety benchmarks, such as jailbreak, adherence to content guidelines, with detailed evaluation results in <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/" target="_blank">OpenAI o1 System Card</a>.
- o1 model is better able to follow instructions, where it can prioritize privileged instructions over user or developer messages.

## Is OpenAI o1 available in the API?

Yes, and it supports function calling, structured outputs, and has vision capabilities. 

o1-pro is also now available in the API, and it's OpenAI's most expensive model yet, costing a jaw-dropping $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens—or roughly 10 times standard o1's cost.

## New Plan: What is ChatGPT _Pro_?

![OpenAI adds a new premium subscription called ChatGPT Pro](/static/blog/openai-o1-and-chatgpt-pro/chatgpt-pro.webp)

ChatGPT Pro is OpenAI's new premium subscription tier for ChatGPT, launched on December 5, 2024. Here’s a short breakdown:

- It costs **$200 per month** — 10x the cost of ChatGPT _Plus_.
- You get **unlimited usage.** No more daily time limits.
- You get **unlimited access** to all of OpenAI's models. This includes _o1 pro mode_ — a more powerful version of OpenAI o1, o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice — the human-like conversational feature.

### What is o1 Pro Mode?

OpenAI’s `o1 pro` model is exclusive for ChatGPT _Pro_ users. It’s a version of o1 that uses more compute to think harder and provide more refined and insightful responses to complex problems in areas like data science, programming, and legal analysis.

o1 pro performs better on challenging ML benchmarks on all fronts. See below and OpenAI for <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/" target="_blank">detailed benchmarks</a>.

![Comparing o1 pro mode with o1-preview and o1](/static/blog/openai-o1-and-chatgpt-pro/o1-pro-mode-comparison.webp)

### Accessing o1 Pro

Pro users can select `o1 pro mode` in the model picker in ChatGPT. To accommodate the longer response times associated with o1 pro mode, users will see a progress bar indicating wait times and receive notifications when tasks are completed.

### Who is it for?

ChatGPT Pro is aimed at researchers, engineers, and professionals who require advanced AI capabilities daily. Compared to other ChatGPT plans, it is significantly more expensive than ChatGPT Plus ($20/month).

> We think the audience for ChatGPT Pro will be the power users of ChatGPT — those who are already pushing the models to the limits of their capabilities on tasks like math, programming, and writing,

_- Jason Wei, a member of OpenAI’s technical staff, said during a livestreamed press conference._

### How much is ChatGPT Pro?

ChatGPT Pro is $200/month.

### ChatGPT _Pro_ vs. ChatGPT _Plus_ - what should you pick?

### Do you need a ChatGPT Pro subscription for o1?

No, all paid ChatGPT users (_Plus_ and _Pro_) can access o1 through the ChatGPT model selector. ChatGPT _Pro_ subscribers will get a better version of o1 (called o1 pro mode) that uses more compute, but it would take longer to generate responses.

## What’s next?

OpenAI has ambitious plans for its o1 reasoning model and the newly introduced ChatGPT Pro subscription plan. OpenAI intends to **continuously improve the o1 model over time**, including adding function calling capability, adding web browsing, file uploads and other performance improvements.

For the _Pro_ plan, OpenAI is planning to introduce more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features. For developers, **o1 support will be available in the API** with support for function calling, developer messages, structured outputs, vision and more in the near future.

Additionally, OpenAI has initiated a grant program through which 10 grants of ChatGPT _Pro_ will be awarded to medical researchers at leading institutions.

## What to expect in 2025

According to recent statements, GPT-5 is expected to be **released in early 2025**, here's an overview of <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-gpt-5" target="_blank">gpt-5</a> and what to expect.

Based on recent developments, there are also reports about OpenAI's plans to increase the price of ChatGPT Plus over the next few years. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- OpenAI currently charges $20 per month for ChatGPT _Plus_.
- Over the next five years, OpenAI intends to "aggressively raise" the cost of ChatGPT Plus, it is expected to reach $44 per month by 2029, according to a report by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>.
