Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have drastically changed how we build AI applications, by giving LLMs access to external knowledge and reducing hallucination. 

But what happens when your application faces complicated queries that require multi-step reasoning? This is where <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/debugging-chatbots-and-ai-agents-with-sessions#:~:text=Use%20of%20RAG%20to%20Improve%20Functionality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional RAG</a> approaches often fall short.

Meanwhile, agents show a lot of promise in driving the next big wave of innovation. So what if we combine AI agents with RAG?

Agentic RAG combines traditional RAG systems with AI agent capabilities to create more autonomous and powerful information retrieval and generation systems. 

While traditional RAG follows a fixed process (query → retrieve → generate), Agentic RAG makes smart decisions at every step, leading to more accurate results and efficient information retrieval.

### The Core Concepts 💡

At its foundation, Agentic RAG enhances traditional RAG with:

1. **Autonomous agents**: AI systems that can look at information, reason, and take action toward specific goals
2. **Dynamic retrieval paths**: The ability to analyze query and choose the appropriate information sources
3. **Reasoning-based verification**: Checking retrieved information before generation
4. **Iterative refinement**: Self-correction through feedback loops

## A Real-World Example of Agentic RAG

Let's see how Agentic RAG handles a complex query in practice:

> **Which rocket was launched first, the Saturn V or the Ariane 5?**

While a human would know that these are two different launch vehicles with distinct timelines, and that we need to research them separately, a simple RAG-based system might struggle with this query because the answer isn't explicitly defined in the source documents.

An Agentic RAG system, however, breaks the query into sub-questions:

1. "When did the Saturn V first launch?"
2. "When did the Ariane 5 first launch?"
3. "Comparing these dates, which is earlier?"

Using multiple retrieval calls, the agent collects the following data:

- **Saturn V**: First launched on **November 9, 1967**.  
- **Ariane 5**: First launched on **June 4, 1996**.

It then compares these dates and concludes:

> **Saturn V was launched first** because 1967 precedes 1996.

## Agentic RAG vs Traditional RAG


Traditional RAG works as a linear process: a user query leads to document retrieval from a vector database, and then an LLM generates a response using the retrieved context. 

This works well for straightforward questions but falls short with complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning. 

In contrast, Agentic RAG:

- Breaks complex queries into simpler sub-questions
- Decides which knowledge sources to query
- Picks the right retrieval strategies
- Validates and combines information from multiple sources
- Asks for more information when needed

In summary: 

| **Feature**              | **Traditional RAG**           | **Agentic RAG**                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Query handling**       | Single-pass processing        | Breaks into sub-queries                   |
| **Retrieval strategy**   | Fixed, pre-determined         | Dynamic, context-dependent                |
| **Information sources**  | Usually one vector database   | Multiple databases, APIs, search engines  |
| **Verification**         | None                          | Active checking of retrieved information  |
| **Adaptability**         | Static workflow               | Adjusts strategy based on initial results |
| **Reasoning capability** | Limited to context window     | Multi-step reasoning across documents     |
| **Failure handling**     | Returns best available answer | Can seek additional information           |
| **Complexity**           | Lower, easier to implement    | Higher, more components to manage         |

## Building Your First Agentic RAG System

Let's create a simple Agentic RAG system that chooses between local document lookup and web search. We will be using CrewAI for the agents and Helicone for monitoring.

### 1. Set up your environment and API keys

First, install required packages and gather any necessary API keys (such as Helicone). 

```python
pip install crewai python-dotenv ...
```

Import libraries and load environment variables:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from crewai import LLM
...

load_dotenv() 
HELICONE_API_KEY=os.getenv('HELICONE_API_KEY')
...
```

### 2. Initialize LLM with Helicone for monitoring

Set up the LLMs you need using CrewAI. Then, integrate them with Helicone's <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions#sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sessions</a> feature to trace every decision your agent makes:

```python
# Initialize LLM
llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {os.getenv('HELICONE_API_KEY')}",
        "Helicone-Session-Id": random(),
        "Helicone-Session-Path": "/agentic_rag",
        "Helicone-Session-Name": "Agentic RAG Workflow",
    }
)

# Other LLMs
...
```

### 3. Implement the decision maker function

This function acts as your agent's brain, determining whether to check local knowledge or use web search:

```python
def check_local_knowledge(query, context):
    """Router function to determine if we can answer from local knowledge"""
    prompt = '''Role: Question-Answering Assistant
Task: Determine whether the system can answer the user's question based on the provided text.
Instructions:
    - Analyze the text and identify if it contains the necessary information to answer the user's question.
    - Provide a clear and concise response indicating whether the system can answer the question or not.
    - Your response should include only a single word. Nothing else, no other text, information, header/footer. 
Output Format:
    - Answer: Yes/No
    ...
'''
    formatted_prompt = prompt.format(text=context, query=query)
    response = llm.invoke(formatted_prompt)
    return response.content.strip().lower() == "yes"
```

### 4. Set up web scraping and vector lookup functionality

Create agents and tools for web searching and content scraping:

```python
def setup_web_scraping_agent():
    """Setup the web scraping agent and related components"""
    search_tool = SerperDevTool()  # Tool for performing web searches
    scrape_website = ScrapeWebsiteTool()  # Tool for extracting data from websites
    
    # Define CrewAI agents
    ...
    
    return crew

def get_web_content(query):
    """Get content from web scraping"""
    crew = setup_web_scraping_agent()
    result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": query})
    return result.raw
```

Process documents and create a searchable vector database:

```python
def setup_vector_db(document_path):
    """Setup vector database from PDF"""
    # Setup vector DB
    ...

    return vector_db

def get_local_content(vector_db, query):
    """Get content from vector database"""
    docs = vector_db.search(query)
    return docs
```

### 5. Create the main query processing function

Tie everything together with a function that routes queries and generates answers:

```python
def process_query(query, vector_db, local_context):
    """Main function to process user query"""
    print(f"Processing query: {query}")
    
    # Step 1: Check if we can answer from local knowledge
    can_answer_locally = check_local_knowledge(query, local_context)
    print(f"Can answer locally: {can_answer_locally}")
    
    # Step 2: Get context either from local DB or web
    if can_answer_locally:
        context = get_local_content(vector_db, query)
        print("Retrieved context from local documents")
    else:
        context = get_web_content(query)
        print("Retrieved context from web scraping")
    
    # Step 3: Generate final answer
    answer = generate_final_answer(context, query)
    return answer
```

This creates a complete Agentic RAG system that intelligently routes queries to the most appropriate knowledge source (local knowledge or web search).

With Helicone's Sessions integration, you can visualize the entire decision path, including: 
- How much each step or the entire process cost
- The Agent(s) deciding which knowledge source to use
- The tool(s) it uses to retrieve information
- The LLM's response and reasoning
