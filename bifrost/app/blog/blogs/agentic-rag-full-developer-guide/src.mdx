Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have drastically changed how we build AI applications, helping LLMs access external knowledge and reduce hallucination. However, as applications get more complex, regular RAG approaches often struggle with complicated queries and multi-step reasoning. 

Meanwhile, agents continue to show a lot of promise as the main drivers of the next big wave of AI innovation. So, what if we could combine AI agents with RAG? 

Enter **Agentic RAG**, a powerful evolution that combines the knowledge retrieval capabilities of RAG with the decision-making abilities of AI agents. 

In this article, we introduce Agentic RAG, compare Agentic RAG vs RAG, and show you how to build and monitor a basic Agentic RAG system.

Agentic RAG combines traditional RAG systems with AI agent capabilities to create more autonomous and powerful information retrieval and generation systems. 

While traditional RAG follows a fixed process (query → retrieve → generate), Agentic RAG makes smart decisions at every step, leading to more accurate and efficient information retrieval.

### Core Concepts

At its foundation, Agentic RAG enhances traditional RAG with:

1. **Autonomous agents**: AI systems that can look at information, reason about it, and take action toward specific goals

2. **Dynamic retrieval paths**: The ability to choose different information sources based on query analysis

3. **Reasoning-based verification**: Checking retrieved information before generation

4. **Iterative refinement**: Self-correction through feedback loops

## Agentic RAG Example

Let's demonstrate the core idea behind Agentic RAG with a simple example.

Consider the question:  

> **Which rocket was launched first, the Saturn V or the Ariane 5?**

While a human would obviously know that these are two different launch vehicles with distinct timelines and to research them separately, a simple RAG-based system might struggle with it since the answer isn't explicitly defined in the source documents.

An Agentic RAG system, however, breaks the query into sub-questions:

1. "When did the Saturn V first launch?"

2. "When did the Ariane 5 first launch?"

3. "Comparing these dates, which is earlier?"

Using multiple retrieval calls, the agent collects the following data:

- **Saturn V**: First launched on **November 9, 1967**.  
- **Ariane 5**: First launched on **June 4, 1996**.

It then compares these dates and concludes:

> **Saturn V was launched first** because 1967 precedes 1996.

---

Traditional RAG works as a linear process: a user query leads to document retrieval from a vector database, and then an LLM generates a response using the retrieved context. 

As shown above, this works well for straightforward questions but falls short with complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning. 

In contrast, Agentic RAG:

- Breaks complex queries into simpler sub-questions

- Decides which knowledge sources to query

- Picks the right retrieval strategies

- Validates and combines information from multiple sources

- Ask for more information when needed

## How to Implement Agentic RAG: A Step-by-step Guide

Now, let's implement a simple Agentic RAG with CrewAI and Helicone for monitoring. 

We'll be using a simple agent that chooses between a local lookup or web search as an example.

### 1. Set Up Environment and API Keys

First, gather any necessary API keys (such as Helicone) and install required packages:

```python
pip install crewai python-dotenv ...
```

Import the required libraries and load environment variables:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from crewai import LLM
...

load_dotenv() 
HELICONE_API_KEY=os.getenv('HELICONE_API_KEY')
...
```

### 2. Initialize Language Models

Set up the various LLMs needed in your workflow using CrewAI, integrating them with <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions#sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone's Sessions</a> for observability:

```python
# Initialize LLM
llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {os.getenv('HELICONE_API_KEY')}",
        "Helicone-Session-Id": random(),
        "Helicone-Session-Path": "/agentic_rag",
        "Helicone-Session-Name": "Agentic RAG Workflow",
    }
)

# Other LLMs
...
```

### 3. Create the Decision Maker Function

Implement a function that acts as the "brain" of the system. 

The function below allows our Agent to determine whether to check local knowledge or browse the web to find the answer to a query:

```python
def check_local_knowledge(query, context):
    """Router function to determine if we can answer from local knowledge"""
    prompt = '''Role: Question-Answering Assistant
Task: Determine whether the system can answer the user's question based on the provided text.
Instructions:
    - Analyze the text and identify if it contains the necessary information to answer the user's question.
    - Provide a clear and concise response indicating whether the system can answer the question or not.
    - Your response should include only a single word. Nothing else, no other text, information, header/footer. 
Output Format:
    - Answer: Yes/No
    ...
'''
    formatted_prompt = prompt.format(text=context, query=query)
    response = llm.invoke(formatted_prompt)
    return response.content.strip().lower() == "yes"
```

### 4. Set Up Web Scraping and Vector Lookup Functionality

Create agents and tools for web searching and content scraping:

```python
def setup_web_scraping_agent():
    """Setup the web scraping agent and related components"""
    search_tool = SerperDevTool()  # Tool for performing web searches
    scrape_website = ScrapeWebsiteTool()  # Tool for extracting data from websites
    
    # Define CrewAI agents
    ...
    
    return crew

def get_web_content(query):
    """Get content from web scraping"""
    crew = setup_web_scraping_agent()
    result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": query})
    return result.raw
```

Process documents and create a searchable vector database:

```python
def setup_vector_db(document_path):
    """Setup vector database from PDF"""
    # Setup vector DB
    ...

    return vector_db

def get_local_content(vector_db, query):
    """Get content from vector database"""
    docs = vector_db.search(query)
    return docs
```

### 5. Create the Main Query Processing Function

Tie everything together with a function that orchestrates the entire process:

```python
def process_query(query, vector_db, local_context):
    """Main function to process user query"""
    print(f"Processing query: {query}")
    
    # Step 1: Check if we can answer from local knowledge
    can_answer_locally = check_local_knowledge(query, local_context)
    print(f"Can answer locally: {can_answer_locally}")
    
    # Step 2: Get context either from local DB or web
    if can_answer_locally:
        context = get_local_content(vector_db, query)
        print("Retrieved context from local documents")
    else:
        context = get_web_content(query)
        print("Retrieved context from web scraping")
    
    # Step 3: Generate final answer
    answer = generate_final_answer(context, query)
    return answer
```

This creates a complete Agentic RAG system that intelligently routes queries between local knowledge and web sources.

With Helicone's Sessions integrated, you can view each step the Agent(s) decides to take, then resolve bugs or perform optimizations.
