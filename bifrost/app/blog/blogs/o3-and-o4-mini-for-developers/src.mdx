In this blog, we will explore the capabilities, benchmarks, and how you can shift to using them in your production apps right away (safely) with Helicone. Let's dive in!

## Table Of Contents

## What's New?

- **Full tool access**: Unlike previous reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini can use *every* tool within ChatGPT—web search, Python, image analysis, file interpretation, and image generation.
- **Agentic capabilities**: These models can make dozens or even hundreds of tool calls in sequence, thinking through complex problems step by step. You'd want to **keep a close eye on token use** with Helicone.
- **"Thinking with images"**: They can directly incorporate images into their reasoning, manipulating and analyzing visual data as part of their thought process.
- **Substantial improvements**: o3 makes 20% fewer major errors than o1 on difficult real-world tasks, while o4-mini provides similar benefits to o3-mini but at a fraction of the cost.
- **Codex CLI**: A lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal, leveraging models like o3 and o4-mini. Quite similar to the much earlier <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/evaluating-claude-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claude Code</a>.

<BottomLine
  title="💡 How are o3 and o4-mini different from previous models?"
  description="Unlike earlier o-series models that could only reason internally, o3 and o4-mini can actively use tools during their reasoning process. This creates a feedback loop where the model can evaluate its own outputs, verify information, and iterate until it reaches a solid answer."

One of the most impressive features is how these models can "think with images." They don't just see an image—they work with it directly in their chain of thought.

This capability allows the models to:
- Analyze blurry, reversed, or low-quality images
- Manipulate images (crop, zoom, rotate) as part of their reasoning
- Interpret whiteboard diagrams, textbook pages, or hand-drawn sketches
- Infer non-obvious information, such as location, via thorough image analysis

Here are some examples:

### 1. Zooming Into Images

### 4. Scientific Problem-Solving

o3 excels at complex scientific math tasks that stumped previous models:

```
Problem: Construct a degree 19 polynomial p(x) in ℂ[x] such that X := {p(x) = p(y)} ⊂ ℙ¹ × ℙ¹ has at least 3 (but not all linear) irreducible components over ℂ. Choose p(x) to be odd, monic, have real coefficients and linear coefficient (-19) and calculate p(19).
```

While o1 struggled to produce a correct solution, o3 methodically worked through the problem, breaking it down into steps, identifying the right approach using Dickson polynomials, and arriving at the correct answer: `1,876,572,071,974,094,803,391,179`.

## o3 and o4-mini Pricing

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | 
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **o3** | $10 / 1M tokens | $40 / 1M tokens |  
| **o4-mini** | $1.10 / 1M tokens | $4.40 / 1M tokens | 
| **o1** | $15.00 / 1M tokens | $60.00 / 1M tokens | 
| **o3-mini** | $3.00 / 1M tokens | $12.00 / 1M tokens | 

<BottomLine
  title="Developer Tip 💡"
  description="o4-mini IS the model to use in terms of price vs performance. It's 63% cheaper than o3-mini, and almost a tenth of the cost of o3, yet performs on par with it!"
/>

## How to Access o3 and o4-mini

Both models can be accessed:

- **Via ChatGPT**: Available now for Plus, Pro, and Team users. Enterprise and Edu users will get access within one week. Free users can try o4-mini by selecting **'Think'** in the composer before submitting. ChatGPT users can also choose the o4-mini-high variant for greater thinking effort.
- **Via API**: Available via Chat Completions API and Responses API. Rolling out gradually so not all developers get access immediately. Users can perform an <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organization verification</a> to gain access if they currently don't have it.

**o3-pro** (like o1-pro for o3) is expected to launch sometime later.

## How to Switch your Apps to OpenAI o3 and o4-mini

Making the leap to a new model can be nerve-wracking, especially if you're running production apps with thousands of users. 

With Helicone, however, you can greatly reduce any potential migration risks. Here's how to go about it without disrupting your services:

1. **Log your current model requests**: Log at least 100 requests in your Helicone dashboard from your app's current model. This creates your performance baseline.
2. **Compare performance**: Test o3 or o4-mini against your current model using identical prompts and inputs. Use Helicone's <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/prompts/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prompt Editor</a> or <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiments</a> feature for systematic comparison.
3. **Analyze results**: Compare outputs, costs, and latency between your current model and o3 or o4-mini side-by-side. Pay special attention to how o3 and o4-mini handle any reasoning tasks and tool use in your applications.
4. **Roll out gradually**: Shift traffic from your current model to o3 or o4-mini incrementally using Helicone's routing features. Start with 10% traffic to the new model and increase as you build confidence. Monitor performance metrics continuously.

## Codex CLI: AI Development in Your Terminal

Alongside o3 and o4-mini, OpenAI released <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codex CLI</a>—an open-source coding agent that runs directly from your terminal. 

![Codex demo](https://marketing-assets-helicone.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/codex-demo.gif)

Codex is built to leverage the reasoning capabilities of these new models, allowing developers to:
- Execute tasks on your computer through natural language
- Process screenshots or hand-drawn sketches to build applications
- Safely run commands and edit files in a sandboxed environment

### Getting Started with Codex

Installation is straightforward:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

After setting your OpenAI API key, you can immediately start using it:

```bash
codex "explain this codebase to me"
```

Or in "full automation" mode:

```bash
codex --approval-mode full-auto "create a flash card app with React"
```

<BottomLine
  title="Security First 💡"
  description="Even in full-auto mode, Codex runs network-disabled and sandboxed to the current directory. For macOS, it uses Apple Seatbelt sandboxing; on Linux, you can run it in a Docker container for additional isolation."
/>

**Fun fact:** To support developers using Codex, OpenAI announced a <a href="https://openai.com/form/codex-open-source-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 million initiative</a> for open-source projects, offering grants of $25,000 in API credits.

## Key Takeaway

{/* o3 and o4-mini represent a significant leap forward in AI capabilities—not just in raw performance, but in how these models can autonomously work through complex problems by combining reasoning and tool use. */}

OpenAI's roadmap is becoming clearer. They're converging the specialized reasoning capabilities of the o-series with the conversational abilities of the GPT series. By unifying these strengths, future models (i.e. GPT-5) will likely support seamless conversations alongside proactive tool use and advanced problem-solving.

But there's a bigger strategic shift happening. OpenAI appears to be making an **aggressive push to win over developers**—traditionally Anthropic's strong point. 

Consider that Codex was made open source, their relentless focus on lower pricing and tool use, and their potential <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/16/openai-in-talks-to-pay-about-3-billion-to-acquire-startup-windsurf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of Windsurf</a>—it's quite clear that they're positioning themselves to take Anthropic's seat as the **AI provider for developers**.
