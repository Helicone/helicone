Building effective AI agents is hard. 

So hard that even tech giants like Apple and Amazon continue to struggle with implementing reliable AI features due to hallucination and inconsistent performance. 

Yet, there's no shortage of tutorials and pre-built agents that make it all seem trivial.

## Understanding Workflows vs. True Agents

Most online tutorials use "AI agent" to describe any system that makes an API call to a large language model. That's not accurate as there's a clear distinction between workflows and agents:

- **Workflows**: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
- **Agents**: Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

The distinction matters because it affects your development approach. **For many applications, workflows are sufficient and more reliable than full agents.**

## When to Use Agents vs. Workflows

| **Use an Agent when...** | **Use a Workflow when...** |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| The number of steps is unpredictable | The task has clear, predictable steps |
| The task requires dynamic decision-making | You need consistent, deterministic behavior |
| Tools and actions need to be selected adaptively | The process can be broken into discrete chunks |

## Core Patterns for Building AI Systems

Whether you're creating workflows or agents, there are a few common workflow patterns you should know. Ideally, you're building with an LLM that is capable of:
- **Retrieval** (Accessing external knowledge from databases or vector stores) 
- **Tool use** (API calls to external services), and 
- **Memory** (Context from previous interactions).

Here are five common workflow patterns for building AI agents:

### 1. Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining decomposes a complex task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. This approach helps by making each individual step simpler and more focused, improving overall accuracy.

**Works best for**: Content creation, multi-step analysis, and processes with natural sequential flow.

### 2. Routing

Routing classifies an input and directs it to specialized handlers. This pattern allows for separation of concerns and enables building more specialized prompts for different categories of input.

**Works best for**: Handling diverse inputs that need to be treated differently.

### 3. Parallelization

Parallelization involves running multiple LLM tasks simultaneously and then combining their outputs. It comes in two main forms:

- **Sectioning**: Breaking a task into independent subtasks that can run in parallel
- **Voting**: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse perspectives or for higher confidence

**Works best for**: Tasks with multiple independent aspects or when seeking consensus.

### 4. Orchestrator-Workers

In this pattern, a central "orchestrator" LLM dynamically breaks down tasks and delegates them to specialized "worker" LLMs. The orchestrator then synthesizes their results into a cohesive response.

**Works best for**: Complex tasks requiring different types of expertise.

### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer

In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM generates content while another evaluates it and provides feedback. This feedback loop continues until the content meets quality criteria.

**Works best for**: Tasks where quality matters and iteration improves results.

## Best Practices for Building Effective Agents

### 1. Don't automate until value is established

Before building an AI agent, ensure the process itself creates value. Many businesses want to automate processes that don't exist yet or haven't been validated manually.

Start by **testing the process manually** to confirm it works and calculating the potential ROI of automating said processâ€”using a formula such as: `(Rate x Hours - Operational costs) Ã· Development costs`.

### 2. Use the right tooling

Many platforms have emerged to make building agents easier and faster, and choosing the right one for your specific use case can significantly impact your success. 

Here are a few popular ones:

- **Dify**: Excellent for rapid prototyping with its no-code interface, making it ideal for teams with mixed technical skills
- **AutoGen**: Strong for multi-agent systems that require deep customization and advanced code execution
- **LlamaIndex**: Optimized for data-intensive applications requiring robust indexing and retrieval
- **LangChain**: Provides modular architecture with reusable components for flexible AI application development
- **CrewAI**: Specializes in creating role-specific AI agents for collaborative tasks
- **Pydantic AI**: Focused on production-grade applications requiring structured output and type safety

When evaluating <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/ai-agent-builders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">agent-building platforms</a>, consider your team's **level of technicality**, **project complexity** and other requirements like **scalability**.

Remember that the right tool isn't necessarily the most complex one. In fact, simpler solutions can often lead to more reliable agents.

### 3. Use dedicated agents

When building AI agents, consider breaking complex workflows into multiple dedicated agents rather than overloading a single agent. 

There's a performance threshold where single agents become ineffectiveâ€”typically when handling more than 5-10 tools, managing complex context, or requiring multiple areas of specialization.

Multi-agent architectures provide several advantages:

- **Modularity**: Easier to develop, test, and maintain individual components
- **Specialization**: Expert agents focused on particular domains (math, coding, planning) tend to perform better
- **Context management**: Allow for better utilization of a limited context window 
- **Controlled communication**: Enable the definition of explicit communication patterns, ensuring controlled and efficient information sharing

{/* <a href="https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/#multi-agent-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Common architectures</a> include supervisor agents (where one agent routes to specialized sub-agents), hierarchical systems (layered supervision), or custom cognitive architectures tailored to your specific domain. When implementing multi-agent systems, carefully consider how agents will communicate - either through shared state objects or via tool-calling parameters. */}

Remember that the goal isn't complexity for its own sake. A thoughtfully designed multi-agent system should improve both reliability and scalability.

### 4. Document your tools and processes

> People spend lots of effort on their prompts but then give the model tools with parameters named 'a' and 'b' with no documentation.

â€” Erik Schluntz, Anthropic

Your tools are only as good to an LLM as their documentation. Treat tool/process documentation like you would a junior developer's onboarding:

- Include example usage
- Document edge cases
- List format requirements
- Keep parameter names descriptive

Think of the LLM as a new team member who needs to learn your API. The clearer your documentation, the more effectively it will work for you.

### 5. Implement proper verification

The more you verify LLM outputs at each step of the way, the more you can rely on your system to get the job done. 

For coding agents, verification is easier because you can run tests. However, you generally want verification steps involving:

- Checks after each significant action
- Human approval for critical steps
- Checkpoints with clear evaluation criteria
- LLMs that review outputs for quality
- Tools like Pydantic to aid with structured outputs
- A human-in-the-loop component (for mission-critical processes), especially in early stages. Once the agent consistently performs well, you can gradually remove this step.

### 6. Start simple and scale gradually

As with any attempt at automation, don't aim to do everything all at once. Instead:

1. Start with a single workflow for a very specific problem
2. Perfect that workflow before adding complexity
3. Use categorization to limit the scope of what your agent handles

### 7. Develop iteratively

Agent development is most efficient when it's iterative. The best approaches include:

- Testing multiple agent architectures to find the optimal solution
- Regular feedback loops with end users
- Continual refinement of prompts and tools
- Adding evaluation metrics (especially for enterprise applications)

Remember that the first version is rarely the bestâ€”successful agents evolve through multiple iterations.

### 8. Measure everything

Effective agent development hinges on measuring performance and iterating on implementations. Without comprehensive measurement, you're building blind. 

The most successful builders follow a core principle: **use the simplest solution possible, and only increase complexity when it demonstrably improves outcomes**.

Establish clear metrics for successâ€”task completion rate, accuracy, or user satisfactionâ€”and implement logging for every significant action. 

A good LLM observability platform like <a href="https://helicone.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a> can provide the measurement infrastructure you need to keep your agents in good shape.

### 9. Add guardrails

Guard rails are protective constraints that prevent the system from producing harmful, incorrect, or irrelevant outputs. You typically want to implement some or all of the following:

- Input validation to catch edge cases
- Output review by a separate LLM call or custom code
- Fallback mechanisms in case of uncertainty
- Rate limiting and usage monitoring

Observability tools like <a href="https://helicone.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a> are great for implementing these easily.

## Debugging and Improving Agent Performance

Debugging agents can be quite tricky because their decision paths are non-deterministic and errors can cascade through multiple steps. 

However, by carefully tracking and analyzing your LLMs' actions at each step of the way, you can greatly simplify the process. Here's how:

### How to debug AI agents 

One easy way to <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/debugging-chatbots-and-ai-agents-with-sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debug AI agents</a> is with step-by-step tracing using Helicone's Sessions feature.

Helicone's Sessions feature provides a structured way to visualize and analyze multi-step agent processes. It groups related requests together, making it easier to trace the flow of information and identify issues.

Session-based tracking is particularly valuable for complex agents because it provides end-to-end visibility and even allows you to view **tool** and **retrieval** actions. 

## Bottom Line

Building effective AI agents isn't about using complex frameworks or architecture. 

It's more about choosing the right level of complexity for your problem, implementing reliable verification systems, scaling gradually, and extensive measurement. 

The most successful implementations follow this pragmatic approach, focusing on simple, composable patterns rather than intricate frameworks.
