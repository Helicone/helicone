Building effective AI agents is hard. 

So hard that even tech giants like Apple and Amazon continue to struggle with implementing reliable AI features due to hallucination and inconsistent performance. 

Yet, there's no shortage of tutorials and pre-built agents that make it all seem trivial.

Let's go beyond the hype and explore some real, practical strategies that work for building actually useful AI agents.

## Understanding AI Agents: Workflows vs. True Agents

Most online tutorials use "AI agent" to describe any system that makes an API call to a large language model. That's not accurate as there's a clear distinction between workflows and agents:

- **Workflows**: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
- **Agents**: Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

This distinction here essentially being that while you "decide" what to do for the LLM in a workflow, a true agent makes this decision on its own.

This matters because it affects your development approach. **For many applications**, workflows are sufficient and more reliable than full agents.

## When to Use Agents vs. Workflows

Use an **agent** when:

- The number of steps is unpredictable
- The task requires dynamic decision-making
- Tools and actions need to be selected adaptively

A **workflow** typically works better when:

- The task has clear, predictable steps
- You need consistent, deterministic behavior
- The process can be broken into discrete chunks

## Core Patterns for Building AI Systems

Whether you're creating workflows or agents, there are a few common workflow patterns you should know. 

Ideally, you're building with an LLM capable of:
- **Retrieval** (Accessing external knowledge from databases or vector stores) 
- **Tool use** (API calls to external services), and 
- **Memory** (Context from previous interactions).

Here they are:

### Workflow Patterns for Building Agents

Here are five common workflow patterns for building AI agents:

#### 1. Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining decomposes a complex task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. This approach helps by making each individual step simpler and more focused, improving overall accuracy.

**Works best for**: Content creation, multi-step analysis, and processes with natural sequential flow.

#### 2. Routing

Routing classifies an input and directs it to specialized handlers. This pattern allows for separation of concerns and enables building more specialized prompts for different categories of input.

**Works best for**: Handling diverse inputs that need to be treated differently.

#### 3. Parallelization

Parallelization involves running multiple LLM tasks simultaneously and then combining their outputs. It comes in two main forms:

- **Sectioning**: Breaking a task into independent subtasks that can run in parallel
- **Voting**: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse perspectives or for higher confidence

**Works best for**: Tasks with multiple independent aspects or when seeking consensus.

#### 4. Orchestrator-Workers

In this pattern, a central "orchestrator" LLM dynamically breaks down tasks and delegates them to specialized "worker" LLMs. The orchestrator then synthesizes their results into a cohesive response.

**Works best for**: Complex tasks requiring different types of expertise.

#### 5. Evaluator-Optimizer

In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM generates content while another evaluates it and provides feedback. This feedback loop continues until the content meets quality criteria.

**Works best for**: Tasks where quality matters and iteration improves results.

## Best Practices for Building Effective Agents

### 1. Document Your Tools

> People spend lots of effort on their prompts but then give the model tools with parameters named 'a' and 'b' with no documentation.

â€” Erik Schluntz, Anthropic

Your tools are only as good to an LLM as their documentation. Treat tool documentation like you would a junior developer's onboarding:

- Include example usage
- Document edge cases
- List format requirements
- Keep parameter names descriptive

Think of the LLM as a new team member who needs to learn your API. The clearer your documentation, the more effectively it will use your tools.

### 2. Implement Proper Verification

The more you verify LLM outputs at each step of the way, the more you can rely on your system to get the job done. 

For coding agents, verification is easier because you can run tests. However, you generally want verification steps involving:

- Checks after each significant action
- Human approval for critical steps
- Checkpoints with clear evaluation criteria
- LLMs that review outputs for quality

### 3. Start Simple and Scale Gradually

As with any attempt at automation, don't aim to do eveything all at once. Instead:

1. Start with a single workflow for a very specific problem
2. Perfect that workflow before adding complexity
3. Use categorization to limit the scope of what your agent handles

### 4. Measure Everything

Effective agent development hinges on measuring performance and iterating on implementations. Without comprehensive measurement, you're building blind. 

The most successful builders follow a core principle: **use the simplest solution possible, and only increase complexity when it demonstrably improves outcomes**.

Establish clear metrics for successâ€”task completion rate, accuracy, or user satisfactionâ€”and implement logging for every significant action. 

A good LLM observability platform like <a href="https://helicone.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a> can provide the measurement infrastructure you need to keep your agents in good shape.

### 5. Add Guard Rails

Guard rails are protective constraints that prevent the system from producing harmful, incorrect, or irrelevant outputs. You typically want to implement some or all of the following:

- Input validation to catch edge cases
- Output review by a separate LLM call or custom code
- Fallback mechanisms in case of uncertainty
- Rate limiting and usage monitoring

Observability tools like <a href="https://helicone.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a> are great for implementing these easily.

## Debugging and Improving Agent Performance

Debugging agents can be quite tricky because their decision paths are non-deterministic and errors can cascade through multiple steps. 

However, by carefully tracking and analyzing your LLMs' actions at each step of the way, you can greatly simplify the process. Here's how:

### How to Debug AI Agents 

One easy way to debug AI agents is with step-by-step tracing using Helicone's Sessions feature.

Helicone's Sessions feature provides a structured way to visualize and analyze multi-step agent processes. It groups related requests together, making it easier to trace the flow of information and identify issues.

       "Helicone-Session-Path": "/support/refund",
     },
   });
```

Session-based tracking is particularly valuable for complex agents because it provides end-to-end visibility and even allows you to view **tool** and **retrieval** actions.

## Bottom Line

Building effective AI agents isn't about using complex frameworks or architecture. 

It's more about choosing the right level of complexity for your problem, implementing reliable verification systems, scaling gradually, and extensive measurement. 

The most successful implementations follow this pragmatic approach, focusing on simple, composable patterns rather than intricate frameworks.
