In December 2024, OpenAI announced o3 and o3-mini, with o3 set to <a href="https://openai.com/index/early-access-for-safety-testing/#how-to-apply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch in early 2025</a> after completing safety testing.

Today, OpenAI released its newest reasoning model, **o3-mini**, positioned as a faster and cheaper alternative to the o1 family, optimized for STEM domains, particularly programming, math, and science.

Building on the foundation of OpenAI's <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o1-and-chatgpt-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">o1 models</a>, the o3 family introduces several notable improvements in performance, deeper level of reasoning capabilities, and testing results.

Let's dive into how o3 compares to top models in the market!

## TL;DR

- o3-mini reportedly outperforms o1-mini in reliability, making `39%` fewer major mistakes on real-world questions, while delivering `24%` faster responses than o1
- o3-mini is `63%` cheaper than o1-mini and competitive with DeepSeek’s R1
- Developers can choose from three reasoning effort levels (low, medium, high) to balance accuracy vs. speed.
- o3-mini is accessible via ChatGPT and through OpenAI’s API

## What sets OpenAI's o3 model apart?

Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs) that rely on simple pattern recognition, the o3 model incorporates a process called **"simulated reasoning" (SR)**, deepening its reasoning capabilities compared to o1.

This allows the model to pause and reflect on its own internal thought processes before responding, mimicking human-like reasoning in a way that previous models like o1 couldn't.

While the o1 models were good at understanding and generating text, the o3 models take it a step further by thinking through problems and planning their responses ahead of time. This "private chain-of-thought" technique is a core feature that sets o3 apart.

### Simulated Reasoning gaining popularity

OpenAI's o3 and o3-mini models both uses simulated reasoning (SR), which is gaining traction lately, with Google launching its own <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/google-gemini-2-0-flash-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</a> and DeepSeek launching their own models based on this approach.

SR allows AI models to consider their own results and adjust their reasoning as they go, offering a more nuanced and accurate form of problem-solving compared to traditional LLMs.

Simulated reasoning models, including **OpenAI's o3**, are designed to scale at inference time. This means they can reason and make decisions faster than previous models, offering real-time responses that can handle complex, multi-faceted tasks.

## o3-mini is a more adaptive model

OpenAI also unveiled the **o3-mini** which is more lightweight and has an adaptive thinking time feature, allowing users to select low, medium, or high processing speeds depending on their needs.

The o3-mini is designed for situations where you might not need the full power of o3 but still want to benefit from its advanced reasoning capabilities.

Although smaller and faster, the o3-mini is still powerful. OpenAI claims that it outperforms o1 on several key benchmarks, making it a great option for those seeking more cost-effective performance.

### o3-mini vs. deepseek's R1 model

Despite its improvements, o3-mini is not a breakthrough across all benchmarks. While it edges out `DeepSeek’s R1 model` in select tests like AIME 2024, it lags in others, such as GPQA Diamond for PhD-level science queries.

O3-mini is `63%` cheaper than o1-mini and competitive with DeepSeek’s R1.

| Model       | Uncached Input Tokens ($/M) | Cached Input Tokens ($/M) | Output Tokens ($/M) |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| o3-mini     | $1.10                       | $0.55                     | $4.40               |
| DeepSeek R1 | $0.55                       | $0.14                     | $2.19               |
| o1-mini     | $3.00                       | $1.50                     | $12.00              |

## Benchmark Comparison: o3 vs o1

### Reasoning Ability

The o3 models are built to simulate reasoning at a deeper level. While o1 could generate responses based on patterns learned during training, o3 actively "thinks" about the problem at hand, improving its ability to tackle complex and multi-step tasks.

### Performance Benchmarks

One of the most exciting aspects of o3 is its performance on various benchmarks. For example, it scored `75.7%` on the <a href="https://arcprize.org/arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARC-AGI</a> visual reasoning benchmarkin low-compute scenarios, which is impressive compared to human-level performance (85%). This was a huge improvement over o1 and shows just how much further o3 can go in solving challenging problems.

### Mathematic and Science

OpenAI reports that o3 also achieved remarkable results in subjects like mathematics and science. For instance, it scored `96.7%` on the American Invitational Mathematics Exam and `87.7%` on a graduate-level science exam. These scores highlight the model's increased capacity for solving complex problems in fields that require high-level reasoning.

## Why not o2?

Why did OpenAI skip o2? According to OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, the decision was purely a matter of avoiding potential trademark issues. The name o2 was not used because it could have clashed with a British telecom company, O2.

So, in the spirit of "OpenAI being really bad at names," Altman humorously explained, the team decided to jump straight to o3 instead. While the name might seem a bit unconventional, the reasoning behind it was purely practical.

## How can developers access o3?

- o3-mini is available in the API (Chat Completions, Assistants, and Batch API)
- o3-mini is also available in ChatGPT and will <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replace o1-mini in the model picker</a>.
