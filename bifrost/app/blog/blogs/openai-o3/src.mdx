In December 2024, OpenAI announced o3 and o3-mini, with o3 set to launch in early 2025. However, plans have changed.

On April 4, 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1908167621624856998" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the company will **release both o3 and a new model o4-mini in "a couple of weeks,"** while delaying GPT-5 until "a few months" later.

Originally, o3's reasoning capabilities were expected to be integrated into GPT-5, but OpenAI has pivoted to releasing both models separately. The delay in GPT-5 is reportedly to make it "much better than originally thought" while addressing integration challenges.

Building on the foundation of OpenAI's o1 models, the o3 family introduces several notable improvements in performance, deeper reasoning capabilities, and better test results. 

Let's dive into how o3 compares to top models in the market!

## What sets OpenAI's o3 model apart?

Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs) that rely on simple pattern recognition, the o3 model incorporates a process called **"simulated reasoning" (SR)**, significantly enhancing its capabilities compared to o1.

This allows the model to pause and reflect on its own internal thought processes before responding, mimicking human-like reasoning in a way that previous models couldn't achieve.

While the o1 models were good at understanding and generating text, the o3 models take it a step further by thinking through problems and planning their responses ahead of time. This "private chain-of-thought" technique is a core feature that sets o3 apart.

### Simulated Reasoning is gaining popularity

OpenAI's o3 and o3-mini models both use simulated reasoning (SR), which is gaining traction lately, with Google launching its own <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/google-gemini-2-0-flash-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</a> and DeepSeek launching their own models based on this approach.

SR allows AI models to consider their own results and adjust their reasoning as they go, offering a more nuanced and accurate form of problem-solving compared to traditional LLMs.

Simulated reasoning models, including **OpenAI's o3**, are designed to scale at inference time. This means they can reason and make decisions faster than previous models, offering real-time responses that can handle complex, multi-faceted tasks.

## o3-mini is a more adaptive model

o3-mini is a more lightweight version of o3 that allows users to select the level of "reasoning effort": low, medium, or high in the API and medium or high (o3-mini-high) in ChatGPT.

o3-mini is designed for situations where you might not need the full power of o3 but still want to benefit from its advanced reasoning capabilities.

Although smaller and faster, o3-mini is still powerful. OpenAI claims that it outperforms o1 on several key benchmarks comparing o3-mini vs o1, making it a great option for those seeking more cost-effective performance.

### o3-mini vs. DeepSeek's R1 model

Despite its improvements, o3-mini is not a breakthrough across all benchmarks. While it edges out `DeepSeek's R1 model` in select tests like AIME 2024, it lags in others, such as GPQA Diamond for PhD-level science queries.

o3-mini is `63%` cheaper than o1-mini and competitive with DeepSeek's R1.

| Model       | Uncached Input Tokens ($/M) | Cached Input Tokens ($/M) | Output Tokens ($/M) |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| o3-mini     | $1.10                       | $0.55                     | $4.40               |
| DeepSeek R1 | $0.55                       | $0.14                     | $2.19               |
| o1-mini     | $3.00                       | $1.50                     | $12.00              |

## o3 vs o1 Benchmarks

### Reasoning Ability

The difference between o1 and o3 is primarily in their reasoning depth. While o1 could generate responses based on patterns learned during training, o3 actively "thinks" about the problem at hand, improving its ability to tackle complex and multi-step tasks.

### Performance Benchmarks

One of the most exciting aspects of o3 is its performance on various benchmarks. For example, it scored `75.7%` on the ARC-AGI visual reasoning benchmark in low-compute scenarios, which is impressive compared to human-level performance (85%). This was a huge improvement over o1 and shows just how much further o3 can go in solving challenging problems.

### Mathematics and Science

OpenAI reports that o3 also achieved remarkable results in subjects like mathematics and science. For instance, it scored `96.7%` on the American Invitational Mathematics Exam and `87.7%` on a graduate-level science exam. These scores highlight the model's increased capacity for solving complex problems in fields that require high-level reasoning.

## How can developers access o3?

- o3-mini will be available in the API (Chat Completions, Assistants, and Batch API)
- o3-mini will also be available in ChatGPT and will replace o1-mini in the model picker
- o3-mini high will be available as a separate model option
- o3 and o4-mini will likely be accessible via API and ChatGPT too

## Integrate OpenAI o3 with Helicone ⚡️

Integrate LLM observability with a few lines of code. See <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/openai/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a> for details.

```js
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: `https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/${HELICONE_API_KEY}/`
});
```

## Bottom Line

The o3 family represents a major milestone for OpenAI towards models that can reason and tackle problems in a more human-like way, with o3-mini being one of the most competent models around, especially with complex tasks like Math and Coding. 

With the upcoming separate releases of o3 and o4-mini—rather than an integrated release as originally planned—OpenAI is signaling that it might have quite a lot to offer in both o3 and the much-awaited GPT-5.

We, for one, are quite excited to see what's in store!
