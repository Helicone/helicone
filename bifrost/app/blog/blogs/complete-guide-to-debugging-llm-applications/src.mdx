## Understanding the Unique Challenges of LLM Debugging

> We hear the same story from nearly every team: 'We shipped a broken tool call chain to prod. It took us 3 hours to trace the root cause.'

Without proper observability, debugging LLM applications is a nightmare.

Debugging LLM applications is fundamentally different from traditional software debugging. Here's why:

### Non-deterministic Behavior

Unlike traditional software where the same input reliably produces the same output, LLMs can generate different responses to identical prompts. This non-deterministic nature makes reproducing and fixing bugs significantly more difficult.

### Multi-step Workflows

Modern LLM applications rarely consist of a single model call. They often involve complex chains of multiple LLM calls, tool and API integrations, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, and vector database queries.

A failure at any point in this chain can cascade through the entire system, making it hard to pinpoint the source of issues.

### Common LLM Failure Modes

LLM applications experience unique forms of failure that traditional debugging tools aren't designed to handle:

1. **<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/how-to-reduce-llm-hallucination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hallucinations</a>**: When models confidently generate factually incorrect information
2. **<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prompt Injection Attacks</a>**: When malicious inputs manipulate model behavior
3. **Format Errors**: When outputs don't match expected formats (JSON, code, etc.)
4. **<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/debugging-chatbots-and-ai-agents-with-sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAG Failures</a>**: When retrieval doesn't return relevant context
5. **Token Limit Overflows**: When inputs exceed model context windows
6. **Tool Call Errors**: When function calling fails due to schema mismatches
7. **Data Leakage**: When sensitive data is leaked to unintended recipients

### Signs Your LLM Application Needs Better Debugging

You might need to improve your debugging approach if you're experiencing:

- Unexplained cost spikes with no corresponding traffic increase
- Users reporting incorrect or nonsensical responses
- System failures that are difficult to reproduce
- Slow response times in production
- Difficulty determining which prompt changes are effective

## Essential Tools for Effective LLM Debugging

### Comprehensive Request Logging

The foundation of LLM debugging is thorough logging of **Input prompts, Generated responses, Metadata (timestamps, model versions, etc.), Token usage and costs, and Latency metrics.**

With <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/quick-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a>, you can implement this with minimal code changes:

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
  },
});
```

This single integration—perhaps the most impactful step in your debugging journey—gives you immediate visibility into all your LLM calls without modifying your existing code structure.

### Multi-step (Agentic) Workflow Tracing

For complex applications, you need to trace entire user journeys across multiple LLM calls. <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone's Sessions feature</a> enables this with just a few additional headers:

Helicone's Sessions also gives you visibility into tool usage, vector database queries, and external API calls.

```javascript
const sessionId = randomUUID();

openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Generate an abstract for a course on space.",
      },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Session-Id": sessionId,
      "Helicone-Session-Path": "/abstract",
      "Helicone-Session-Name": "Course Planning Workflow",
    },
  }
);
```

## Step-by-Step Guide to Debugging Common LLM Issues

### Debugging Hallucinations

Hallucinations occur when LLMs generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information despite appearing confident.

**Steps to debug:**

1. **Identify hallucination patterns**: Use Helicone to filter for requests with negative user feedback
2. **Check prompt clarity**: Examine if the prompt is ambiguous or lacks specific instructions
3. **Review RAG inputs**: Verify if retrieved context is accurate and relevant
4. **Test prompt variations**: Use <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/guides/cookbooks/debugging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone's Playground</a> to experiment with more precise prompts
5. **Implement verification steps**: Add explicit fact-checking steps in your application flow

### Debugging Prompt Injection Attacks

Prompt injections occur when malicious users attempt to manipulate your LLM by inserting commands in their inputs.

**Steps to debug:**

1. **Monitor for abnormal behavior**: Parse logs and use Helicone's real-time alerts to spot and get notified of unusual response patterns
2. **Examine suspicious inputs**: Review user prompts that trigger unexpected model behavior and react appropriately
3. **Implement security headers**: Add <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/llm-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone's security feature</a> with a simple header to easily detect and block malicious inputs

```python
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}],
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-LLM-Security-Enabled": "true", # Enable basic security
        "Helicone-LLM-Security-Advanced": "true" # Enable advanced security
    }
)
```

### Debugging Token Limit Issues

Token limit issues occur when inputs exceed the model's context window or when costs unexpectedly increase.

**Steps to debug:**

1. **Track token usage**: Use Helicone's built-in token tracking for all requests
2. **Identify expensive endpoints**: Filter for routes or users consuming excessive tokens
3. **Optimize prompt templates**: Experiment with more token-efficient prompts
4. **Implement chunking strategies**: Break large inputs into manageable pieces
5. **Set up alerts**: Configure notifications for abnormal token usage

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Replaying and Modifying Sessions

For deep debugging, you can <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/guides/cookbooks/replay-session" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replay entire user sessions</a> with modifications to see how changes impact outcomes:

```javascript
// Create a new session ID for the replay
const replaySessionId = randomUUID();

// Loop through original requests with modifications
for (const request of originalRequests) {
  const modifiedRequest = modifyRequestBody(request);

  // Send modified request with the same session structure
  await sendRequest(modifiedRequest, replaySessionId, sessionPath, sessionName);
}
```

This technique is invaluable for testing prompt improvements on real-world interactions without affecting users.
