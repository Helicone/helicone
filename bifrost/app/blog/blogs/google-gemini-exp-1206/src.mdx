## What sets Gemini-Exp-1206 apart?

### Massive Context Window

Gemini-exp-1206 has a `2,097,152 token` context window, significantly larger than most publicly available LLMs. This allows the model to:

- Process and understand extremely long pieces of text
- Maintain context across extensive documents
- Handle large codebases more effectively
- Tackle complex reasoning tasks with a broader range of information

### Advanced Alignment Techniques

Gemini-Exp-1206 benefits from enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) processes. This fine-tuning enables it to generate responses that align closely with user expectations while maintaining coherence across lengthy interactions.

### Free Access

Google has made Gemini-exp-1206 freely available through Google AI Studio and the Gemini API. Some developers have turned away from `gpt-o1` and are using `gemini-exp-1206` instead of paying for the ChatGPT Pro subscription. This accessibility allows developers and researchers to experiment with and integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities without cost barriers.
