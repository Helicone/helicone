OpenAI has just released its **o1-Pro** model to its API, bringing its most powerful reasoning model to developers. Previously only available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers, this model comes with remarkable capabilitiesâ€”and a price tag to match. 

At $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens, it's now officially OpenAI's **most expensive model**, eclipsing GPT-4.5 by a factor of 2x for input and 4x for output costs.

But is it worth the premium? Let's examine what this model offers, how it performs, and whether it justifies its steep price for your development needs.

## What's New in o1-Pro: The Quick Rundown

| **Feature** | **Details** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Advanced Reasoning** | Uses more compute than standard o1 for "thinking harder" on complex problems |
| **Pricing** | $150/million input tokens <br /> $600/million output tokens <br /> (10x more expensive than regular o1) |
| **Context Window** | 200,000 tokens (same as o1) |
| **Output Limit** | 100,000 tokens maximum per completion |
| **Knowledge Cutoff** | October 2023 (same as other recent OpenAI models) |
| **API Access** | Only available through the new Responses API (not Chat Completions) |
| **Function Calling** | Supported, alongside structured outputs |
| **Image Input** | Can process images as input, but output is text-only |
| **Streaming** | Not supportedâ€”another first for an OpenAI model |

## o1-Pro's Technical Capabilities 

o1-Pro is OpenAI's next step in reasoning models. Unlike standard o1, which already excels at mathematical and logical reasoning, o1-Pro allocates additional computational resources to the reasoning process. 

This means it "thinks harder" about problems, potentially leading to more reliable solutions for complex tasks.

<BottomLine
  title="ðŸ’¡ Please note:"
  description="o1-Pro is the first OpenAI model that's only available through their newer Responses APIâ€”not the standard Chat Completions endpoint that most developers are familiar with. This means you'll need to update your integration code to use this model."
/>

### Basic example of using o1-Pro:

```javascript
// Using the newer Responses API required for o1-Pro
const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "o1-pro",
  input: "Explain the implications of GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems for modern mathematics.",
  reasoning: { effort: "high" } // Optional parameter for o1-pro
});

console.log(response.content);
```

The `reasoning` parameter with `effort` set to "high" instructs the model to allocate even more computational resources to its answerâ€”at an increased token cost, of course.

## o1-Pro Pricing: Premium Costs for Premium Results

o1-Pro's pricing makes it OpenAI's most expensive model by a significant margin:

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **o1-pro** | **$150.00/1M tokens** | **$600.00/1M tokens** |
| gpt-4.5 | $75.00/1M tokens | $150.00/1M tokens |
| o1 | $15.00/1M tokens | $60.00/1M tokens |
| o3-mini | $1.10/1M tokens | $4.40/1M tokens |
| gpt-4o | $5.00/1M tokens | $15.00/1M tokens |

## OpenAI o1-Pro Benchmarks and Real-World Performance  

o1-Pro's real-world performance has been met with mixed reviews. For some tasks, it shows remarkable capabilities that justify its premium pricing:

- **Coding**: o1-Pro has remarkable coding abilities, especially when it comes to large codebases and higher-level instructions. Developers report that o1-Pro can analyze massive codebases and identify subtle bugs that were previously overlooked by themselves and other models.
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: The model shows improved mathematical reasoning capabilities compared to o1, which is already one of the best available models for math.
- **Step-by-Step Problem Solving**: For multi-step logical reasoning tasks, o1-Pro maintains coherence better than other models.

## OpenAI o1-Pro Limitations

- **Vision Capabilities**: Despite handling image inputs, early testing has shown that o1-Pro <a href="https://simonwillison.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggles with basic vision tasks</a> like counting fingers, identifying unusual body postures, and reading analog clocks.
- **Processing Speed**: Many users report that o1-Pro is **significantly slower** than other models, making it less suitable for interactive applications requiring quick responses.
- **Cost Prohibitive**: The extreme pricing creates significant barriers to experimentation and iterative development. One user reported <a href="https://x.com/taesiri/status/1902955371855282387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spending $10 on just five simple vision task prompts</a>, with three tests failing.
- **Unpredictable Costs**: Users report that large context windows can sometimes cause the model to error out, requiring multiple attempts and increasing costs unexpectedly.

## o1-Pro Use Cases: When to Pay the Premium

Given its price point, o1-Pro is best suited for specific high-value use cases:

1. **Complex Code Refactoring**: When dealing with large, complex codebases that could take a human engineer a while to fully comprehend by themselves.
2. **Scientific Research**: For generating hypotheses or analyzing complex research data where deeper reasoning is valuable.
3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating high-quality training examples for fine-tuning smaller, specialized models.
4. **Legal or Financial Document Analysis**: When accuracy and thorough reasoning are worth the premium cost.

For general purposes, models like GPT-4o or o3-mini likely provide better value. Many developers report using o1-Pro selectively as a "final check" or for particularly difficult problems rather than as their primary model.

    {
      question: "Does o1-Pro show its reasoning?",
      answer: "Unlike some models that expose their chain-of-thought reasoning, o1-Pro's internal reasoning process remains hidden. You're charged for these thinking tokens, but can't view them."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there rate limits for o1-Pro?",
      answer: "Yes. Rate limits vary by tier, with Tier 1 users getting 30,000 tokens per minute, scaling up to much higher limits for Tier 5 users."

## Final Thoughts

o1-Pro represents a significant advancement in OpenAI's reasoning capabilities, but its pricing puts it firmly in the "specialty tool" category rather than an everyday solution. For developers working on highly complex problems where accuracy and reliability are paramount, o1-Pro may be worth the premium cost.

For most applications, however, models like o3-mini offer a more economical choice with comparable performance on many tasks. 

The release of o1-Pro to the API also signals OpenAI's continued push toward specialized models optimized for specific types of tasks, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
