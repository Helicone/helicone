## Implementation Considerations

Here's what to carefully consider before you implement any observability solution:

### 1. Integration Approach

| **Aspect**                         | **Things to Consider**                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proxy-based        | Do you want minimal code changes and API-level integration? Can you tolerate slight latency for added features like caching and rate limiting? |
| SDK-based | Are you able to modify your codebase? Do you need fine-grained control for complex workflows? Is low latency critical?                         |

### 2. Data Privacy & Security

| **Aspect**                         | **Things to Consider**                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-hosting                       | Do you need full control over your data infrastructure for compliance or regulatory reasons?                                                        |
| Data retention                     | What duration of data storage aligns with your compliance or operational needs?                                                                |
| PII handling                       | Are there mechanisms in place to redact, encrypt, or limit access to sensitive user data?                                                      |
| Compliance                         | Does the platform meet certifications like SOC 2, HIPAA, or GDPR that your organization requires?                                              |

### 3. Scalability Requirements

| **Aspect**                         | **Things to Consider**                                                                                                                         |
