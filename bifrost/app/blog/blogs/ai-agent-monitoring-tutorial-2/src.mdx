In <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/ai-agent-monitoring-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1 of this tutorial</a>, we built a financial research assistant that had some concerning issues. While our agent could fetch Tesla's stock price and news, it failed to properly handle knowledge base queries and inappropriately searched for information it already knew.

Now it's time to fix these problems using Helicone's comprehensive observability features.

## The Problems We Need to Fix

From Part 1, we identified several critical issues:

1. **RAG retrieval failure**: Our agent couldn't find GreenEnergy's profit margin despite having it in the knowledge base
2. **Inappropriate tool usage**: The agent searched its knowledge base for information about Elon Musk instead of using its general knowledge
3. **Hidden performance issues**: Without proper monitoring, we couldn't see what was actually happening in our agent's decision-making process

Let's fix these systematically.

## Adding Comprehensive Monitoring with Helicone Sessions

First, we need visibility into every step of our agent's workflow. Helicone's <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sessions feature</a> allows us to trace multi-step interactions and see exactly where things go wrong.

### Step 1: Install Helicone Helpers

```bash
npm install @helicone/helpers
```

### Step 2: Add Session Tracking

We'll modify our code to track each tool/RAG call and LLM interaction as part of a session:

```javascript
import { HeliconeManualLogger } from '@helicone/helpers';
import crypto from 'crypto';

// Initialize Helicone manual logger
const heliconeLogger = new HeliconeManualLogger({
  apiKey: process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY,
  headers: {
    "Helicone-Property-Type": "Financial-Research-Agent"
  }
});

// Session management
let sessionId;
let sessionHeaders;

// Function to start a new session
function startNewSession() {
  sessionId = crypto.randomUUID();
  sessionHeaders = {
    "Helicone-Session-Id": sessionId,
    "Helicone-Session-Name": "Financial Research Session",
    "Helicone-Session-Path": "/financial-research",
  };
  console.log(`\nStarted new session: ${sessionId}`);
}
```

### Step 3: Add Detailed Tool Logging

Now we'll wrap each tool/RAG call with comprehensive logging using the <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/integration-method/custom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone ManualLogger</a>—this step isn't required, but provides greater visibility.

<details>
<summary>Snippet for implementing logging</summary>

```javascript
// Function to search for company information with Helicone logging
async function searchCompanyInfo(query, vectorStore) {
  return heliconeLogger.logRequest(
    {
      _type: "vector_db",
      operation: "search",
      text: query,
      topK: 2,
      databaseName: "company_profiles_db",
      metadata: {
        searchType: "similarity_search_with_score",
        threshold: 0.9, // This threshold is too high!
        requestTime: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    },
    async (resultRecorder) => {
      console.log("Searching for company information in knowledge base...");
      
      const resultsWithScores = await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore(query, 2);
      
      if (resultsWithScores.length === 0 || resultsWithScores[0][1] < 0.9) {
        const result = {
          found: false,
          message: "No relevant company information found in the knowledge base."
        };
        
        resultRecorder.appendResults({
          results: result,
          matchCount: 0,
          bestScore: resultsWithScores[0]?.[1] || 0,
          searchLatency: 50,
          status: "no_match"
        });
        
        return result;
      }
      
      // Process successful results...
    },
    {
      ...sessionHeaders,
      "Helicone-Session-Path": `/financial-research/company-search/${query.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}`
    }
  );
}
```
</details>


With this setup, let's test our agent and see what's happening in the Helicone dashboard.

![Helicone Sessions dashboard showing agent behavior before fixes](/static/blog/ai-agent-monitoring-tutorial-2/helicone-session-before-fix.webp)

The dashboard reveals the exact problems:
- Vector DB searches, while successful, are failing to return appropriate results
- The agent is making unnecessary knowledge base searches for general information
- We can see the complete decision tree leading to these failures

## Fix #1: Adjusting the RAG Threshold

The first issue is clear from our dashboard—the similarity threshold of 0.9 is too restrictive (can be viewed by clicking on the **vector_db** call row). 

Even relevant documents about GreenEnergy aren't meeting this threshold.

Let's update our code to use a lower threshold of 0.7.

```javascript
// Change this line in searchCompanyInfo function
if (resultsWithScores.length === 0 || resultsWithScores[0][1] < 0.7) { // Reduced from 0.9 to 0.7
```

## Fix #2: Improving Tool Selection Logic

The second issue requires a more sophisticated approach. Our agent is using tools when it should rely on its general knowledge. Let's update the system prompt to be more specific:

```javascript
async function processQuery(userQuery, vectorStore) {
  let messages = [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You're a financial assistant. Use the provided tools to answer the user's questions, but only when necessary.  

              Available tools:
              1. getStockData - Fetches current stock price information for a specific ticker symbol
              2. getStockNews - Retrieves recent news articles about a company based on its ticker symbol
              3. searchCompanyInfo - Searches the knowledge base for detailed information about companies or financial concepts

              NOTES:
              - DO NOT use tools for general knowledge questions that you can answer directly
              - ONLY use tools when you need:
                * Current stock prices or market data
                * Recent news about specific companies
                * Detailed information about unknown companies
              - If you have sufficient information to provide an accurate and complete answer from your existing knowledge, respond directly without using tools
              `
    },
    { role: "user", content: userQuery }
  ];
  
  // Rest of the function...
}
```

However, testing this change alone doesn't fully resolve the issue. The model still tends to overuse tools.

## Fix #3: Upgrading the Model

Sometimes more sophisticated reasoning requires a more capable model. Let's upgrade from **GPT-3.5 Turbo** to **GPT-4o Mini**:

```javascript
const llmResp = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini", // Upgraded from "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  tools,
  messages,
  temperature: 0.1,
}, {
  headers: {
    ...currentSessionHeaders,
    "Helicone-Prompt-Id": lastToolUsed ? `${lastToolUsed}-response` : "financial-research-reasoning"
  }
});
```

<BottomLine
  title="Why Model Upgrades Matter 💡"
  description="GPT-4o Mini has better reasoning capabilities for understanding when NOT to use tools, leading to more appropriate tool selection and fewer unnecessary API calls."
/>

## Testing Our Fixes

Let's run our improved agent and see the results:

> Prompt: Who is Elon Musk?

**Before fixes**: Agent searches knowledge base, finds nothing, then provides answer

**After fixes**: Agent directly answers from general knowledge without unnecessary tool calls

> Prompt: What is GreenEnergy's profit margin?

**Before fixes**: Agent fails to find information despite having it in knowledge base

**After fixes**: Agent successfully retrieves "GreenEnergy Corp has a profit margin of 14%"

![Helicone Sessions dashboard showing improved agent behavior after fixes, with proper tool usage and successful retrieval](/static/blog/ai-agent-monitoring-tutorial-2/helicone-session-after-fix.webp)

The improved dashboard shows:

- Appropriate tool selection (no unnecessary knowledge base searches)
- Successful vector database retrievals with lower threshold
- Clean decision paths with better reasoning
- Reduced token usage from fewer unnecessary tool calls

## Discovering Hidden Issues

One powerful benefit of comprehensive monitoring is discovering problems you didn't know existed. In our Helicone dashboard, we can see **429 rate limit** errors that were previously invisible in the CLI:

```
Status: 429 Error
Error: Rate limit exceeded for model gpt-4o-mini
```

These errors didn't cause complete failures but added significant latency to responses. Without Helicone's observability, we might never have noticed these delays in a production environment.

To fix rate limiting issues, you can:
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Add request queuing 
- Monitor usage patterns to optimize request timing
- Consider upgrading API tier limits if needed

## Key Insights from Monitoring

Through this process, we learned several critical lessons:

1. **Similarity thresholds need empirical testing**: Our initial 0.9 threshold was too conservative
2. **Tool selection requires explicit guidance**: Even advanced models need clear instructions about when NOT to use tools
3. **Model capabilities matter**: GPT-4o Mini's better reasoning significantly improved tool selection
4. **Hidden errors impact performance**: Rate limiting and other issues are invisible without proper monitoring
5. **Session-based tracing is essential**: Understanding the complete decision flow is crucial for debugging complex agents

## Conclusion

Building reliable AI agents requires more than just getting the basic functionality working. Through comprehensive monitoring with Helicone Sessions, we:

- **Identified** the root causes of retrieval failures and inappropriate tool usage
- **Fixed** threshold issues and improved reasoning with better prompts and model upgrades  
- **Discovered** hidden performance issues like rate limiting that would have been invisible otherwise
- **Optimized** our agent's decision-making process for better performance and lower costs

The difference between a working agent and a production-ready agent is observability. With the right monitoring tools, you can build agents that not only work correctly but continue to perform reliably as they scale.

<FAQ 
  items={[
    {
      question: "Why did changing the similarity threshold fix the retrieval issue?",
      answer: "Vector similarity scores can vary significantly based on the embedding model and text content. A threshold of 0.9 was too restrictive, filtering out relevant documents that had slightly lower similarity scores. Reducing to 0.7 allowed the system to retrieve contextually relevant information while maintaining quality."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I determine the right similarity threshold for my RAG system?",
      answer: "Start with empirical testing using your actual data. Test various thresholds (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8) and manually evaluate the quality of retrieved documents. Helicone's logging can easily reveal where RAG retrieval is failing, helping you know what needs to be improved. Consider implementing dynamic thresholds based on query type or confidence levels."
    },
    {
      question: "Why did upgrading from GPT-3.5 Turbo to GPT-4o Mini improve tool selection?",
      answer: "GPT-4o Mini has better reasoning capabilities for understanding context and following complex instructions about when NOT to use tools. It's more effective at distinguishing between queries that require external data versus those that can be answered from general knowledge, leading to more appropriate tool selection and reduced unnecessary API calls."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I prevent rate limiting issues in production?",
      answer: "Implement exponential backoff retry logic, add request queuing to smooth out traffic spikes, monitor usage patterns to identify peak times, and consider upgrading your API tier if you consistently hit limits. Helicone's monitoring can help you identify rate limiting patterns before they become critical issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What other metrics should I monitor for production AI agents?",
      answer: "Beyond what we covered, monitor: user satisfaction scores, end-to-end response times, cost per successful interaction, tool success rates, error patterns by user segment, and prompt effectiveness over time. Set up alerts in Helicone for sudden changes in these metrics to catch issues early."
