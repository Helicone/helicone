2. **Open-Source** - Fully open-source, encouraging community contributions and customizations.
3. **Tracing** - Provides tracing capabilities for LLM interactions, including session tracking.
4. **Prompt Management** - Offers prompt versioning and management features.

### How Does Langfuse Compare to Helicone?

Langfuse distinguishes itself by emphasizing ease of self-hosting and simplicity in setup. Its exclusive reliance on PostgreSQL as the sole database backend simplifies deployment and is well-suited for low-volume projects or developers who prefer managing their own infrastructure. This makes Langfuse an attractive option for teams or individual developers focusing on small to medium-scale applications.

However, as data volume increases, PostgreSQL may face performance limitations. Additionally, without a data streaming platform like **Kafka**, there can be challenges with scaling and data persistence; if the system goes down, logs may be lost.
