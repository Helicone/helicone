## Langfuse

**Designed for: Hobbyists and Small Teams with Low-Volume Projects**

![Langfuse Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langfuse-alternatives/langfuse-traces.webp)

### What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is an open-source LLM observability tool that offers tracing and monitoring capabilities. It emphasizes ease of self-hosting, making it accessible for small teams or individual developers who prefer to manage their own infrastructure. Langfuse runs on a PostgreSQL database, simplifying the self-hosting process but potentially limiting scalability for high-volume applications.

### Top Features

1. **Self-Hosting Focus** - Designed for easy self-deployment, allowing teams to manage their own infrastructure.
2. **Open-Source** - Fully open-source, encouraging community contributions and customizations.
3. **Tracing** - Provides tracing capabilities for LLM interactions, including session tracking.
4. **Prompt Management** - Offers prompt versioning and management features.

### How Does Langfuse Compare to Helicone?

Langfuse distinguishes itself by emphasizing ease of self-hosting and simplicity in setup. Its exclusive reliance on PostgreSQL as the sole database backend simplifies deployment and is well-suited for low-volume projects or developers who prefer managing their own infrastructure. This makes Langfuse an attractive option for small teams or individual developers focusing on smaller-scale applications.

However, as data volume increases, PostgreSQL may face performance limitations. Additionally, without a data streaming platform like **Kafka**, there can be challenges with scaling and data persistence; if the system goes down, logs may be lost.

In comparison, Helicone's infrastructure utilizes both **ClickHouse** and **Kafka**. ClickHouse efficiently handles large-scale data analytics, while Kafka ensures high-throughput data ingestion and data persistence, preventing log loss even during downtime. This combination allows Helicone to handle high traffic seamlessly and scale efficiently, ensuring analytics remain fast and responsive even with billions of logs. Helicone's cloud-focused approach provides higher scalability, advanced features, and greater reliability, making it better suited for applications with high usage or complex requirements.
