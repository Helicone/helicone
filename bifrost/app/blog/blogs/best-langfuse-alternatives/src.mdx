## Langfuse: Open-Source LLM Observability

![Langfuse Dashboard Image](/static/blog/langfuse-alternatives/langfuse-traces.webp)

### What is Langfuse?

Langfuse is one of the most popular open-source LLM observability tools, with over 20K GitHub stars and 26M+ SDK installs per month. It offers robust tracing, evaluation, and prompt management capabilities.

Langfuse was acquired by ClickHouse in January 2026. The team continues to build Langfuse as an open-source, self-hostable product, now with deeper infrastructure backing.

### Top Features

1. **Open-Source & Self-Hostable** - Fully open-source (MIT license for core features) with self-hosting as a first-class path
2. **Tracing & Agent Observability** - Comprehensive tracing with Agent Graphs (GA), dedicated observation types for agents, tools, guardrails, and more
3. **Prompt Management** - Prompt versioning, A/B testing, playground, and prompt experiments against datasets
4. **OpenTelemetry Integration** - Native support for OpenTelemetry, extending language support to Java, Go, and any OTLP-compatible framework
5. **Evaluation** - LLM-as-a-judge, annotation queues, dataset experiments, and score analytics

### Langfuse Architecture

Langfuse v3 uses a distributed, event-driven architecture:

1. **ClickHouse**: The main analytical data store for traces, observations, and scores. ClickHouse is a column-oriented database optimized for high write throughput and fast analytical queries at scale. Some of Langfuse's largest users ingest billions of rows.

2. **PostgreSQL**: Retained for transactional data such as authentication, project configuration, and prompt management.

3. **Redis/Valkey**: Used for event queuing and caching of API keys and prompts. Ingestion requests are queued and processed asynchronously by a separate worker container.

4. **S3/Blob Storage**: Stores large objects and acts as a durable buffer — incoming traces are written to S3 first, then ingested into ClickHouse by the worker, ensuring data is not lost during traffic spikes.

5. **SDK and OpenTelemetry**: Langfuse integrates through native SDKs in Python and JavaScript (built on OpenTelemetry), and also accepts traces via its OTLP endpoint from any OpenTelemetry-compatible instrumentation. This extends support to additional languages and 50+ frameworks.

This architecture represents a significant evolution from Langfuse's original single-container PostgreSQL setup. The v3 architecture is the same codebase that powers Langfuse Cloud.

### How Does Langfuse Compare to Helicone?

Langfuse distinguishes itself by emphasizing ease of self-hosting and simplicity in setup. This makes Langfuse an attractive option for teams or individual developers focusing on small to medium-scale applications.

However, as data volume increases, PostgreSQL may face performance limitations. Additionally, without a data streaming platform like **Kafka**, there can be challenges with scaling and data persistence; if the system goes down, logs may be lost.

<BottomLine
  title="Bottom Line 💡"
  description="For teams that prioritize ease of deployment and don't anticipate extremely high traffic volumes, Langfuse's architecture may be the perfect fit. Its simpler architecture means fewer components to maintain and troubleshoot, potentially leading to lower operational overhead."
