## What We've Built in the Past Six Months

### üöÄ Sessions

We've made it easier to group and visualize **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>multi-step LLM interactions</span>**. By adding just **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>two simple headers</span>**, you can track request flows across multiple traces and gain valuable insights into complex AI workflows.

### ‚ú® Prompt Management

You can manage and version your prompts directly in our UI, **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>making it easy to collaborate with your team</span>**. If you prefer to handle prompts in your codebase, that's fine too‚Äîwe'll automatically version them via our proxy without changing your workflow.

### üß™ Prompt Experiments

Run experiments using historical datasets to test, evaluate, and improve your prompts over time. This helps **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>prevent regressions in your production systems</span>** and ensures your prompts keep getting better.

### üìö Datasets

You can now build datasets from your requests. **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Add, duplicate, and edit</span>** requests in your dataset, and export them when you're ready. Create a **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>golden dataset</span>** to fine-tune your models and easily export it to your favorite fine-tuning platform like OpenPipe.

### üõ°Ô∏è LLM Moderations & Security

We've added features to help detect **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>phishing, prompt injections, adversarial instructions, anomalies, and data exfiltration</span>**. These tools help you maintain the security and integrity of your AI applications.

### üõ†Ô∏è Entire Backend Rewrite: Never Lose a Log Again

We've completely overhauled our backend and integrated **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Kafka</span>**, achieving incredible scalability and bulletproof log persistence. What does this mean for you? Simply put, **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>we promise we'll never lose a log again</span>**.

![Never Lose a Log Again](/static/blog/helicone-recap/loselogs2.webp)

To give you an idea of the scale we're operating at, we've handled over **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>2 billion LLM logs</span>** and processed more than **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>1.5 trillion tokens</span>**. We're committed to supporting your needs, no matter how big they grow.

In our dedication to transparency, we've released anonymized stats at [us.helicone.ai/open-stats](https://us.helicone.ai/open-stats), so you can see for yourself how robust Helicone's services truly are.

Curious about how we made this happen? Dive into the details in our blog post: [Handling Billions of LLM Logs with Upstash Kafka and Cloudflare Workers](https://upstash.com/blog/implementing-upstash-kafka-with-cloudflare-workers). We share the behind-the-scenes story of our transformation and how it benefits you.
