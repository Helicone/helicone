### üõ†Ô∏è Entire Backend Rewrite - Never Lose a Log Again

We've completely overhauled our backend and integrated <a href="https://upstash.com/blog/implementing-upstash-kafka-with-cloudflare-workers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kafka</a>, achieving incredible scalability and bulletproof log persistence. What does this mean for you? Simply put, we promise we'll never lose a log again.

![Never Lose a Log Again](/static/blog/helicone-recap/loselogs2.webp)

To give you an idea of the scale we're operating at, we've handled over **2 billion LLM logs** and processed more than **1.5 trillion tokens**. We're committed to supporting your needs, no matter how big they grow.

In our dedication to transparency, we've released <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/open-stats" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anonymized stats</a>, so you can see for yourself how robust Helicone's services truly are.

Curious about how we made this happen? Dive into the details in our blog post: [Handling Billions of LLM Logs with Upstash Kafka and Cloudflare Workers](https://upstash.com/blog/implementing-upstash-kafka-with-cloudflare-workers). We share the behind-the-scenes story of our transformation and how it benefits you.
