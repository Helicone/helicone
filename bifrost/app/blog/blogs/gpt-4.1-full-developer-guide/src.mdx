OpenAI has just released GPT-4.1, and in typical OpenAI fashion, they've baffled everyone with their naming scheme again. 

Just when we thought we were finally moving to GPT-5, they've surprised us with GPT-4.1—a model that is in many ways an upgrade from <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/gpt-4.5-benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPT-4.5</a>. 

But naming conventions aside, this release is significant. GPT-4.1 introduces a family of three models designed specifically for developers, featuring major improvements in coding, instruction following, and long context handling.

## Table Of Contents

## What's New in GPT-4.1?

- **A family of three non-thinking models**: GPT-4.1 (full-size), GPT-4.1 Mini (balanced), and GPT-4.1 Nano (small and fast), each targeting different use cases and price points.
- **Massive context window**: All three models support up to **1 million tokens of context**, 8x more than GPT-4o's 128K limit. Perfect for processing entire codebases or lengthy documents.
- **API-only release**: Unlike previous models, GPT-4.1 is exclusively available <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the API</a>, not in ChatGPT's interface. 
- **Knowledge cutoff of June 2024**: GPT-4.1 has the most recent cutoff of any OpenAI model.
- **Lower pricing across the board**: The main GPT-4.1 model is 26% cheaper than GPT-4o, while GPT-4.1 Mini outperforms GPT-4o on many benchmarks at 83% lower cost.
- **Developer-focused**: Built specifically for developer workflows with extensive real-world testing of coding capabilities.

## GPT-4.1 Performance Benchmarks & Code Generation

{/* GPT-4.1 delivers significant improvements across key metrics. Here's how it performs on benchmarks: */}

### Coding Performance

The coding improvements are substantial:

- **SWE-bench Verified**: One test measuring ability to solve real GitHub issues in actual codebases, GPT-4.1 scored 54.6%, far outperforming GPT-4o (33.2%) and GPT-4.5 (28%).
- **Code Diff Accuracy**: When asked to modify only specific parts of code instead of rewriting entire files, GPT-4.1 achieved 52.9% accuracy compared to GPT-4o's 18.3%.
- **Extraneous Edits**: GPT-4.1 rarely touches files it shouldn't, with unnecessary edits dropping from 9% (with GPT-4o) to just 2%.
- **Real-world Testing**: Windsurf, a popular coding tool, reports that GPT-4.1 scored 60% higher on their internal benchmarks and was 30% more efficient at using programming tools.

### Instruction Following

* **Complex Instructions**: When given difficult multi-step instructions with specific formatting requirements, GPT-4.1 correctly followed them 49% of the time compared to GPT-4o's 29%.
* **Multi-turn Conversations**: On the MultiChallenge benchmark testing how well models maintain context through conversation, GPT-4.1 scored 38.3%, a 10.5% improvement over GPT-4o.
* **Following Constraints**: When explicitly told what not to do, GPT-4.1 achieved 87.4% compliance on the IFEval benchmark versus 81.0% for GPT-4o.

### Long Context Performance

* **Context Window**: All three GPT-4.1 models can process up to 1 million tokens at once—8 times more than GPT-4o's 128K limit.
* **Finding Specific Information**: When challenged to locate particular information in massive documents (the "needle-in-haystack" test), GPT-4.1 achieved 100% accuracy across all context lengths.
* **Video Understanding**: On tests analyzing 30-60 minute videos without subtitles, GPT-4.1 scored 72.0%, improving 6.7% over GPT-4o.

## How to Access GPT-4.1

GPT-4.1 is available exclusively through the OpenAI API. Use the model string `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, or `gpt-4.1-nano` in your requests.

You can easily start testing these models in the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/prompts?models=gpt-4.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI Playground</a>.

## Effective Prompting Techniques for GPT-4.1

Based on OpenAI's <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official prompting guide</a>, here are the most effective techniques for getting the best results from GPT-4.1:

- **Be extremely clear and specific**: GPT-4.1 follows instructions more literally than previous models. If the output is different from your expectations, a single sentence describing your desired behavior is usually enough. 
- **Use delimiters effectively**: Markdown sections (###), XML tags, and backticks for code help structure your prompt. For document retrieval, XML tags performed best in testing.
- **For agent workflows**: Include reminders about persistence ("keep going until the user's query is completely resolved"), tool-calling ("use your tools to read files, don't guess"), and planning ("plan extensively before each function call").
- **For long context**: Place your most important instructions at both the beginning AND end of your prompt. 
- **For complex reasoning**: While not a reasoning model like o3, GPT-4.1 responds well to step-by-step prompting. Try adding: "First, think carefully step by step about..." to break down complex problems.
- **For code editing**: GPT-4.1 excels at creating code diffs rather than rewriting entire files. It's significantly better than previous models at modifying only the necessary parts of code.

## How to Safely Test GPT-4.1 in Production

Want to try GPT-4.1 without disrupting your existing apps? Here's how you can use Helicone to make the transition seamless:

1. **Log your current model requests**: Log at least 10 logs in your Helicone dashboard. This will give you a baseline of performance.
2. **Compare performance**: Test GPT-4.1 against your current model with identical prompts and inputs. The <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/prompts/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prompt Editor</a> or <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experiments</a> feature are designed for this purpose. 
3. **Analyze results**: Compare outputs, costs, and latency between your current model and GPT-4.1 side-by-side. Make sure GPT-4.1 meets your requirements with your actual production prompts.
4. **Roll out gradually**: Shift traffic from your current model to GPT-4.1 incrementally. Make sure to monitor the performance in Helicone.

## Final Thoughts

GPT-4.1 represents a significant step forward for developers using AI. Its focus on real-world utility rather than just benchmark scores makes it particularly valuable for production applications. 

The introduction of GPT-4.1 Mini and Nano variants provides flexible options for different use cases and budget constraints, while the massive 1 million token context window—now quickly becoming the norm—opens new possibilities for complex application development.

OpenAI has promised two new models (<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">o3</a> and o4-mini) will follow shortly, so stay tuned for those!
