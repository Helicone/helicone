## FAQ

### 1. What if Iâ€™m already a Helicone user?

If you are on the free plan, this promo also applies to you! You are able to receive a $500 credit as long as you are a **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>new Growth user</span>**.

### 2. Why should I choose Helicone for observability?

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>We are open-source!</span>** We think you will love the 1-line integration that takes just a few minutes to set up. The generous free tier offers 10k requests per month so you can access almost all of Heliconeâ€™s feature for free. We only make money when you grow.

_P.S. when you upgrade to Growth, you wonâ€™t be charged as long as you are under 10k requests per month._

### 4. Whatâ€™s the difference between free and Growth plan?

**<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>The amount of limit.</span>** Growth plan allows you to **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>pay as you go</span>**. However, if your app get a ton of traffic while on a free plan, we will still log the incoming requests, you just wonâ€™t see past 10k requests on Helicone.

- âœ… Labeling and tagging
