AutoGPT is diligently developing their <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Benchmarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Auto-GPT-Benchmarks repository</a>. Their goal? To construct the optimal evaluation pipeline for comparing different agents.

AutoGPT is fully leveraging the capabilities of Helicone without modifying a single line of code. Here are the key features that facilitate this synergy:

- **Proxy Integration:** Helicone's role as a proxy allows AutoGPT to maintain their codebase intact. Learn more about this feature in our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/tools/mitm-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MITM Proxy documentation</a>.
- **Caching:** For minor code modifications that don't necessitate re-calling the LLM for an entire CI pipeline, requests can be cached on edge servers. This feature saves AutoGPT over $10 per PR! You can read more about this in our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caching documentation</a>.
- **GraphQL:** Our data extraction API enables AutoGPT to generate custom reports upon the completion of a CI job.

## AutoGPT's Workflow with Helicone

AutoGPT's workflow leverages Helicone's Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) tools. This allows the interception of all traffic that would have been directed to OpenAI from their CI machine and reroutes it to Helicone. Consequently, AutoGPT can now utilize all of Helicone's features.

### Integration

AutoGPT employed a MITM approach to capture all logs intended for OpenAI. Here is a code snippet showcasing how this was accomplished:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helicone/helicone/main/mitmproxy.sh)" -s start

```

Within the benchmarks, AutoGPT implemented a Python library where they could set specific custom properties for detailed measurements, as shown here. You can learn more about this in our <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Properties documentation</a>.

```python
HeliconeLockManager.write_custom_property("job_id", "1")
HeliconeLockManager.write_custom_property("agent", "smol-developer")
```

If AutoGPT wants to enable caching, they can do so by simply setting an environment variable like this:

```bash
export HELICONE_CACHE_ENABLED="true"
```

The total integration process required at most 5 lines of code, which enabled AutoGPT to immediately get rich dashboards and save costs on their CI jobs.

### Data Ingest

AutoGPT can track how different agents are impacting their costs.

If they wish to examine specific requests, they can do this by using the filter feature.

### Determining Cost Savings

For scenarios where testing the agent's functionality is needed but calling the API is not, such as small code changes, they can monitor their cache usage effortlessly through the dashboards. Here's an example:

We also maintain a log of each cached request, ensuring that caching is effective and marking agents as "Cacheable Agents".

## The Road Ahead

We are currently developing a suite of GraphQL endpoints that will allow AutoGPT to easily ingest some of their data and add it directly to the reports after a run.

This development is being paired with deep links so that we can have a tight integration between report generation and Helicone. Here is a preview of what a benchmark report will look like:
