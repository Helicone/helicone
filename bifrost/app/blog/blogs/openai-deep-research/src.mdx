OpenAIâ€™s release of Deep Research came just as the AI community was processing the impact of DeepSeek R1 and its advancements.

This timing led many to view it as OpenAIâ€™s response to the growing threat of open-source tools like DeepSeek. In an interesting turn of events, an open-source alternative to Deep Research appeared just 12 hours after its release to quite <a href="https://x.com/dzhng/status/1888299647845961909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive impression</a> from the developer community.

Despite the ongoing tug-of-war between open-source and "Open" AI, Deep Research has proven itself to be quite a powerful tool.

This article takes a close look at OpenAIâ€™s Deep Research, examining how it works, its strengths, limitations, benchmark results, and comparisons with the similarly named Gemini Deep Research, to determine if it truly delivers on its promises.

## What is OpenAI Deep Research?

Deep Research is an AI-powered automated research agent designed for users who need in-depth analysis of complex topics. Unlike standard LLM outputs that rely on pre-trained knowledge, Deep Research:

- Accesses and synthesizes real-time web data by browsing online sources.
- Conducts multi-step reasoning to answer queries requiring deeper context.
- Generates long-form reports with citations and detailed explanations.

### Who Should Use Deep Research?

Deep Research is aimed at professionals in fields that require extensive information retrieval, including:

- **Finance**: Competitive market analysis, investment research.
- **Science & Engineering**: Research synthesis, literature reviews.
- **Policy & Law**: Legal case studies, policy analysis.
- **Business & E-Commerce**: Product comparisons, consumer insights.

## How Deep Research Works

Deep Research is built on an OpenAI o3 model optimized for web browsing, data analysis, and multi-step reasoning.

It employs **end-to-end reinforcement learning** for complex search and synthesis tasks, effectively combining LLM "reasoning" with real-time web browsing.

Here is an overview of how it works:

1. **Query Interpretation & Clarifications**
   - Deep Research first parses the userâ€™s query and asks for clarifications if needed (e.g., location for price comparisons).
2. **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**:
   - Retrieves top-ranked search results and extracts relevant information.
3. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Summarizes findings and identifies patterns.
   - Conducts multi-document summarization and citation tracking.
   - Analyzes and plots tabular data and figures using Python.
4. **Report Generation**
   - Outputs structured reports, complete with citations.
   - Embeds generated images, tables, and charts.

## Benchmark Results

According to results released by OpenAI, Deep Research outperforms previous models on key benchmarks.

### **Humanityâ€™s Last Exam**

This tests accuracy on "Expert-Level" questions on over 100 subjects.

| Model                    | Accuracy (%) |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| GPT-4o                   | 3.3          |
| Grok-2                   | 3.8          |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet        | 4.3          |
| Gemini Thinking          | 6.2          |
| OpenAI o1                | 9.1          |
| DeepSeek-R1\*            | 9.4          |
| OpenAI o3-mini (high)    | 13.0         |
| **OpenAI Deep Research** | **26.6**     |

**<a href="https://lastexam.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanityâ€™s Last Exam (HLE)</a>** is a rigorous AI benchmark
designed to test LLMs on a broad range of expert-level academic subjects.

It spans disciplines including classics, ecology, law, and mathematics, and measures how well AI can handle questions that challenge even seasoned domain experts.

### **GAIA Benchmark**

| Model Configuration  | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Avg. Accuracy |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Previous Top Results | 67.92   | 67.44   | 42.31   | 63.64         |
| Deep Research        | 78.66   | 73.21   | 58.03   | 72.57         |

**<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fibxvahvs3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a>** (General AI Assistant
Benchmark) is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants on real-world problem-solving
tasks.

GAIA measures an AI system's ability to handle complex, human-like reasoning, multimodal inputs, web browsing, and tool-use proficiency.

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on professional skill-based evaluations, GAIA challenges AI systems with tasks that are simple for humans but remain difficult for current models.

For example, while GPT-4 equipped with plugins scores 15%, human respondents achieve 92%, highlighting a significant gap in AI performance on practical, reasoning-based tasks.

## Strengths & Limitations of Deep Research

### Strengths

- **Detailed Summarization**: Extracts and condenses complex concepts effectively.
- **Accurate Numerical Data**: References are often correct, especially in structured fields.
- **Multi-Step Query Handling**: Can refine prompts for better results.
- **Time Savings**: Automates hours of manual research in minutes, given high-quality sources.

### Limitations

- **Hallucinations**: Fabricates sources, misinterprets data, and cites incorrect factsâ€”which will be hidden in a lengthy report!
- **Inconsistent Information**: Might contradict itself, promote bias, or provide outdated data.
- **Lack of Original Insights**: Struggles to generate new hypotheses or interpret nuanced academic discussions.
