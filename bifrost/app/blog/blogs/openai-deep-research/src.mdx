OpenAIâ€™s release of **Deep Research** came just as the AI community was processing the impact of DeepSeek R1 and its advancements.

This timing led many to view it as OpenAIâ€™s response to the growing threat of open-source tools like DeepSeek.

Interestingly, OpenAI wasnâ€™t the first company to enter the research automation spaceâ€”Google had already introduced **Gemini Deep Research** shortly before.

Moreover, an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Deep Research appeared just 12 hours after its release to quite <a href="https://x.com/dzhng/status/1888299647845961909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">positive impression</a> from the developer community, to be followed less than a month later by **Perplexity...Deep Research**.

In an ocean filled with "deep researchers," OpenAI has thrown in a heavyweight contenderâ€”researching "deeper" than most.

This article takes a close look at OpenAIâ€™s Deep Research, examining how it works, its strengths, limitations, benchmark results, and comparisons with the similarly named Gemini Deep Research and Perplexity Deep Research, to determine if it truly delivers on its promises.

## What is OpenAI Deep Research?

Deep Research is an AI-powered automated research agent designed for users who need in-depth analysis of complex topics. Unlike standard LLM outputs that rely on pre-trained knowledge, Deep Research:

- Accesses and synthesizes real-time web data by browsing online sources.
- Conducts multi-step reasoning to answer queries requiring deeper context.
- Generates long-form reports with citations and detailed explanations.

### Who Should Use Deep Research?

Deep Research is aimed at professionals in fields that require extensive information retrieval, including:

- **Finance**: Competitive market analysis, investment research.
- **Science & Engineering**: Research synthesis, literature reviews.
- **Policy & Law**: Legal case studies, policy analysis.
- **Business & E-Commerce**: Product comparisons, consumer insights.

## How Deep Research Works

Deep Research is built on an OpenAI o3 model optimized for web browsing, data analysis, and multi-step reasoning.

It employs **end-to-end reinforcement learning** for complex search and synthesis tasks, effectively combining LLM "reasoning" with real-time web browsing.

Here is an overview of how it works:

1. **Query Interpretation & Clarifications**
   - Deep Research first parses the userâ€™s query and asks for clarifications if needed (e.g., location for price comparisons).
2. **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**:
   - Retrieves top-ranked search results and extracts relevant information.
3. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Summarizes findings and identifies patterns.
   - Conducts multi-document summarization and citation tracking.
   - Analyzes and plots tabular data and figures using Python.
4. **Report Generation**
   - Outputs structured reports, complete with citations.
   - Embeds generated images, tables, and charts.

## Benchmark Results

According to results released by OpenAI, Deep Research outperforms previous models on key benchmarks.

### **Humanityâ€™s Last Exam**

This tests accuracy on "Expert-Level" questions on over 100 subjects.

| Model                    | Accuracy (%) |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| GPT-4o                   | 3.3          |
| Grok-2                   | 3.8          |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet        | 4.3          |
| Gemini Thinking          | 6.2          |
| OpenAI o1                | 9.1          |
| DeepSeek-R1\*            | 9.4          |
| OpenAI o3-mini (high)    | 13.0         |
| Perplexity Deep Research    | 21.1         |
| **OpenAI Deep Research** | **26.6**     |

**<a href="https://lastexam.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanityâ€™s Last Exam (HLE)</a>** is a rigorous AI benchmark
designed to test LLMs on a broad range of expert-level academic subjects.

It spans disciplines including classics, ecology, law, and mathematics, and measures how well AI can handle questions that challenge even seasoned domain experts.

### **GAIA Benchmark**

| Model Configuration  | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Avg. Accuracy |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Previous Top Results | 67.92   | 67.44   | 42.31   | 63.64         |
| Deep Research        | 78.66   | 73.21   | 58.03   | 72.57         |

**<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fibxvahvs3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a>** (General AI Assistant
Benchmark) is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants on real-world problem-solving
tasks.

GAIA measures an AI system's ability to handle complex, human-like reasoning, multimodal inputs, web browsing, and tool-use proficiency.

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on professional skill-based evaluations, GAIA challenges AI systems with tasks that are simple for humans but remain difficult for current models.

For example, while GPT-4 equipped with plugins scores 15%, human respondents achieve 92%, highlighting a significant gap in AI performance on practical, reasoning-based tasks.

## Strengths & Limitations of Deep Research

### Strengths

- **Detailed Summarization**: Extracts and condenses complex concepts effectively.
- **Accurate Numerical Data**: References are often correct, especially in structured fields.
- **Multi-Step Query Handling**: Can refine prompts for better results.
- **Time Savings**: Automates hours of manual research in minutes, given high-quality sources.

### Limitations

- **Hallucinations**: Fabricates sources, misinterprets data, and cites incorrect factsâ€”which will be hidden in a lengthy report!
- **Inconsistent Information**: Might contradict itself, promote bias, or provide outdated data.
- **Lack of Original Insights**: Struggles to generate new hypotheses or interpret nuanced academic discussions.

## OpenAI Deep Research vs. Googleâ€™s Deep Research vs. Perplexity Deep Research

Let's compare OpenAI Deep Research with its older namesake from Googleâ€”<a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini Deep Research</a> and the newly-launched <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perplexity Deep Research</a>.

Here's the revised comparison table including Perplexity Deep Research:

| Feature                | OpenAI Deep Research       | Google Deep Research      | Perplexity Deep Research    |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cost**               | $200/month               | $20/month                | Free (5 queries/day) or $20/month |
| **Level of Detail**    | Highly detailed reports  | More concise reports     | Concise but structured summaries |
| **Search Behavior**    | Uses web sources and research papers | Primarily web sources | Academic paper-heavy, but also uses real-time data |
| **Accuracy**          | Reasonably accurate      | More prone to SEO bias   | High accuracy, slightly below OpenAI |
| **Citation Reliability** | Mixed, some fake sources | Sometimes references unrelated sources | Generally reliable citations |
| **Use Case Suitability** | Technical & academic research | General web-based research | Research, journalistic inquiries, real-time data |
| **Input Types**       | Text, images, PDFs, spreadsheets | Primarily text | Text-based queries, limited file handling |
| **Output**            | Reports with sources, summaries, and embedded visuals | Reports with key findings & sources | Concise summaries with inline citations |
| **Transparency**      | Shows step-by-step reasoning process | Uses a pre-planned research path | Displays reasoning and search steps |
| **Processing Time**   | 5â€“30 minutes per query   | Typically under 15 minutes | 2-4 minutes per query |

### Key Takeaways:

- **OpenAIâ€™s Deep Research** is the most powerful but also the most expensive, best for technical and academic research.
- **Googleâ€™s Deep Research** is more affordable but prone to SEO-driven biases and less reliable citations.
- **Perplexity Deep Research** is the fastest and offers a free tier, making it ideal for quick, structured research with inline citations.
