OpenAI‚Äôs release of **Deep Research** came just as the AI community was processing the impact of DeepSeek R1 and its advancements. This timing led many to view it as OpenAI‚Äôs response to the growing threat of open-source tools like DeepSeek.

Interestingly, OpenAI wasn‚Äôt the first company to enter the research automation space‚ÄîGoogle had already introduced **Gemini Deep Research** shortly before.

Moreover, an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Deep Research appeared <a href="https://x.com/dzhng/status/1888299647845961909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just 12 hours after its release</a>, gaining positive impression from the developer community, to be followed less than a month later by... **Perplexity Deep Research**.

In an ocean filled with "deep researchers," OpenAI has thrown in a heavyweight contender‚Äîresearching "deeper" than most.

This article takes a close look at OpenAI‚Äôs Deep Research, examining how it works, its strengths, limitations, benchmark results, and comparisons with the similarly named Gemini Deep Research and Perplexity Deep Research, **and if it truly delivers on its promises.**

## What is OpenAI Deep Research?

Deep Research is an AI-powered automated research agent designed for users who need in-depth analysis of complex topics. Unlike standard LLM outputs that rely on pre-trained knowledge. Deep Research:

- ‚úÖ Accesses and synthesizes real-time web data by browsing online sources.
- ‚úÖ Conducts multi-step reasoning to answer queries requiring deeper context.
- ‚úÖ Generates long-form reports with citations and detailed explanations.

### Who should use Deep Research?

Deep Research is aimed at professionals in fields that require extensive information retrieval, including:

- **Finance** ‚Äî Competitive market analysis, investment research.
- **Science & Engineering** ‚Äî Research synthesis, literature reviews.
- **Policy & Law** ‚Äî Legal case studies, policy analysis.
- **Business & E-Commerce** ‚Äî Product comparisons, consumer insights.

## How OpenAI Deep Research Works

Deep Research is built on an <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI o3 model</a> optimized for web browsing, data analysis, and multi-step reasoning.

It employs **end-to-end reinforcement learning** for complex search and synthesis tasks, effectively combining LLM "reasoning" with real-time web browsing.

Here is an overview of how it works:

1. **Query Interpretation & Clarifications**
   - Deep Research first parses the user‚Äôs query and asks for clarifications if needed (e.g., location for price comparisons).
2. **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**:
   - Retrieves top-ranked search results and extracts relevant information.
3. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Summarizes findings and identifies patterns.
   - Conducts multi-document summarization and citation tracking.
   - Analyzes and plots tabular data and figures using Python.
4. **Report Generation**
   - Outputs structured reports, complete with citations.
   - Embeds generated images, tables, and charts.

## Benchmark Results

According to <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's official results</a>, Deep Research outperforms previous models on key benchmarks.

### Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam

Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam (HLE) is a rigorous AI benchmark designed to test LLMs on a broad range of expert-level academic subjects.

The <a href="https://lastexam.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanity's Last Exam</a> spans disciplines including classics, ecology, law, and mathematics, and measures how well AI can handle questions that challenge even seasoned domain experts.

This tests accuracy on "Expert-Level" questions on over 100 subjects.

### GAIA Benchmark

GAIA (General AI Assistant Benchmark) is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI assistants on real-world problem solving tasks. **<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fibxvahvs3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a>** measures an AI system's ability to handle complex, human-like reasoning, multimodal inputs, web browsing, and tool-use proficiency.

| Model Configuration                                                                                                        | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Avg. Accuracy |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- |
| <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous top results</a> | 67.92     | 67.44     | 42.31     | 63.64         |
| **Deep Research**                                                                                                          | **78.66** | **73.21** | **58.03** | **72.57**     |

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on professional skill-based evaluations, GAIA challenges AI systems with tasks that are simple for humans but remain difficult for current models.

For example, while GPT-4 equipped with plugins scores `15%`, human respondents achieve `92%`, highlighting a significant gap in AI performance on practical, reasoning-based tasks.

### Open Deep Research vs. OpenAI Deep Research

Open Deep Research (2nd option mentioned above) is an AI-powered research assistant that performs iterative, deep research by leveraging search engines, web scraping, and large language models (LLMs).

Unlike OpenAI‚Äôs Deep Research, it is designed as a lightweight and highly customizable tool for developers who need full control over their research pipeline.

Key Features include:

- **Iterative Research**: Generates search queries, processes results, and refines research direction over time.
- **Intelligent Query Generation**: Uses LLMs to produce targeted search queries based on research goals.
- **Depth & Breadth Control**: Users can configure how deep (iterations) and broad (query diversity) the research expands.
- **Smart Follow-ups**: Dynamically generates follow-up questions to refine research insights.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Produces structured markdown reports containing key findings and sources.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple searches simultaneously for increased efficiency.
