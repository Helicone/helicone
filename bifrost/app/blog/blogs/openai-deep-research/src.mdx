OpenAI's release of **Deep Research** came just as the AI community was processing the impact of DeepSeek R1 and its advancements. This timing led many to view it as OpenAI's response to the growing threat of open-source tools like DeepSeek.

Interestingly, OpenAI wasn't the first company to enter the research automation space—Google had already introduced **Gemini Deep Research** shortly before.

Moreover, an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Deep Research emerged <a href="https://x.com/dzhng/status/1888299647845961909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just 12 hours after its release</a>, gaining positive impressions from the developer community. Less than a month later, **Perplexity Deep Research** was also launched.

In an ocean filled with "deep researchers," OpenAI has introduced a heavyweight contender-one that researches "deeper" than most.

This article takes a close look at OpenAI's Deep Research, examining how it works, its strengths, limitations, benchmark results, and comparisons with the similarly named Gemini Deep Research and Perplexity Deep Research. **Let's see if it truly delivers on its promises.**

## What is OpenAI Deep Research?

Deep Research is an AI-powered automated research agent designed for users who need in-depth analysis of complex topics. Unlike standard LLM outputs that rely on pre-trained knowledge, Deep Research:

- ✅ Accesses and synthesizes real-time web data through online source browsing
- ✅ Conducts multi-step reasoning to answer queries requiring deeper context
- ✅ Generates long-form reports with citations and detailed explanations

### Who should use Deep Research?

Deep Research is designed for professionals in fields that require extensive information retrieval, including:

- **Finance** — Competitive market analysis, investment research
- **Science & Engineering** — Research synthesis, literature reviews
- **Policy & Law** — Legal case studies, policy analysis
- **Business & E-Commerce** — Product comparisons, consumer insights

## How OpenAI Deep Research Works

Deep Research is built on an <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI o3 model</a> that has been optimized for web browsing, data analysis, and multi-step reasoning.

It uses **end-to-end reinforcement learning** to handle complex search and synthesis tasks, effectively combining LLM reasoning capabilities with real-time web browsing.

Here is how it works:

1. **Query Interpretation & Clarification**
   - Deep Research analyzes the user's query and requests clarifications when needed (e.g., specific location for price comparisons)
2. **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**
   - Retrieves and processes top-ranked search results
   - Extracts relevant information from multiple sources
3. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Summarizes findings and identifies patterns
   - Performs multi-document summarization with citation tracking
   - Analyzes and visualizes tabular data and figures using Python
4. **Report Generation**
   - Creates structured reports with proper citations
   - Incorporates generated images, tables, and charts

## OpenAI Deep Research Benchmark Results

According to <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's official results</a>, the Deep Research model significantly outperforms previous models on key benchmarks.

### Humanity's Last Exam

Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) is a rigorous AI benchmark that evaluates LLMs across a broad range of expert-level academic subjects.

The <a href="https://lastexam.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanity's Last Exam</a> encompasses disciplines including classics, ecology, law, and mathematics, testing how well AI systems handle questions that challenge even seasoned domain experts.

This benchmark measures accuracy on "Expert-Level" questions across more than 100 subjects.

### GAIA Benchmark

GAIA (General AI Assistant Benchmark) is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess AI assistants on real-world problem-solving tasks. **<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fibxvahvs3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a>** evaluates an AI system's capabilities in complex reasoning, multimodal input processing, web browsing, and tool utilization.

| Model Configuration                                                                                                        | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Avg. Accuracy |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- |
| <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous top results</a> | 67.92     | 67.44     | 42.31     | 63.64         |
| **Deep Research**                                                                                                          | **78.66** | **73.21** | **58.03** | **72.57**     |

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on professional skill-based evaluations, GAIA challenges AI systems with tasks that humans find straightforward but remain challenging for current models.

For example, while GPT-4 with plugins achieves only `15%` accuracy, human respondents score `92%`, highlighting a significant gap in AI performance on practical, reasoning-based tasks.
