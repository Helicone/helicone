Moreover, an open-source alternative to OpenAI's Deep Research emerged <a href="https://x.com/dzhng/status/1888299647845961909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just 12 hours after its release</a>, gaining positive impressions from the developer community. Less than a month later, **Perplexity Deep Research** was also launched.

In an ocean filled with "deep researchers," OpenAI has introduced a heavyweight contender-one that researches "deeper" than most.

This article takes a close look at OpenAI's Deep Research, examining how it works, its strengths, limitations, benchmark results, and comparisons with the similarly named Gemini Deep Research and Perplexity Deep Research. **Let's see if it truly delivers on its promises.**

## What is OpenAI Deep Research?

Deep Research is an AI-powered automated research agent designed for users who need in-depth analysis of complex topics. Unlike standard LLM outputs that rely on pre-trained knowledge, Deep Research:

- ‚úÖ Accesses and synthesizes real-time web data through online source browsing
- ‚úÖ Conducts multi-step reasoning to answer queries requiring deeper context
- ‚úÖ Generates long-form reports with citations and detailed explanations

### Who should use Deep Research?

Deep Research is designed for professionals in fields that require extensive information retrieval, including:

- **Finance** ‚Äî Competitive market analysis, investment research
- **Science & Engineering** ‚Äî Research synthesis, literature reviews
- **Policy & Law** ‚Äî Legal case studies, policy analysis

## How OpenAI Deep Research Works

Deep Research is built on an <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI o3 model</a> that has been optimized for web browsing, data analysis, and multi-step reasoning.

It uses **end-to-end reinforcement learning** to handle complex search and synthesis tasks, effectively combining LLM reasoning capabilities with real-time web browsing.

Here is how it works:

1. **Query Interpretation & Clarification**
   - Deep Research analyzes the user's query and requests clarifications when needed (e.g., specific location for price comparisons)
2. **Web Scraping & Data Extraction**
   - Retrieves and processes top-ranked search results
   - Extracts relevant information from multiple sources
3. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Summarizes findings and identifies patterns
   - Performs multi-document summarization with citation tracking
   - Analyzes and visualizes tabular data and figures using Python
4. **Report Generation**
   - Creates structured reports with proper citations
   - Incorporates generated images, tables, and charts

## OpenAI Deep Research Benchmark Results

According to <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's official results</a>, the Deep Research model significantly outperforms previous models on key benchmarks.

### Humanity's Last Exam

Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) is a rigorous AI benchmark that evaluates LLMs across a broad range of expert-level academic subjects.

The <a href="https://lastexam.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humanity's Last Exam</a> encompasses disciplines including classics, ecology, law, and mathematics, testing how well AI systems handle questions that challenge even seasoned domain experts.

This benchmark measures accuracy on "Expert-Level" questions across more than 100 subjects.

### GAIA Benchmark

GAIA (General AI Assistant Benchmark) is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess AI assistants on real-world problem-solving tasks. **<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fibxvahvs3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAIA</a>** evaluates an AI system's capabilities in complex reasoning, multimodal input processing, web browsing, and tool utilization.

| Model Configuration                                                                                                        | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Avg. Accuracy |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- |
| <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previous top results</a> | 67.92     | 67.44     | 42.31     | 63.64         |
| **Deep Research**                                                                                                          | **78.66** | **73.21** | **58.03** | **72.57**     |

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that focus on professional skill-based evaluations, GAIA challenges AI systems with tasks that humans find straightforward but remain challenging for current models.

For example, while GPT-4 with plugins achieves only `15%` accuracy, human respondents score `92%`, highlighting a significant gap in AI performance on practical, reasoning-based tasks.
