But is it truly better than the top models in the market? Let’s take a look at how `Llama 3.3 70B Instruct` compares with previous models and why it's a big deal.

## Comparing Llama 3.3 with Llama 3.1

### Faster Inference Speed

Llama 3.3 70B is a high-performance replacement for Llama 3.1 70B. Independent benchmarks indicate that Llama 3.3 70B achieves an inference speed of 276 tokens per second on Groq hardware, <a href="https://groq.com/new-ai-inference-speed-benchmark-for-llama-3-3-70b-powered-by-groq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing Llama 3.1 70B by 25 tokens per second</a>. This makes it a viable option for real-time applications where latency is critical.

### Fewer Parameters, Similar Performance

Despite its smaller size, <a href="https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/1865079068833780155" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta claimed</a> that Llama 3.3 has powerful performance comparable to the much larger Llama 3.1 405B model. With significantly lower computational overhead, developers can deploy it using mid-tier GPUs or run the model locally <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/#how-i-ran-llama-3-3-70b-on-my-machine-using-ollama" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on their consumer-grade laptops</a>.

### Multilingual Support for a Global Audience

Like its predecessor Llama 3.1, Llama 3.3 also supports 8 languages, including English, Germain, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai. The model is versatile for developers who are targeting global audiences. On the Multilingual MGSM (0-shot) test, it scored 91.1, which is similar to its predecessor Llama 3.1 70B (91.6) and close to more advanced models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet (92.8). [More on this later](#performance-benchmarks).

### More cost-effective

Llama 3.3 70B has a significant advantage over its costs:

- `$0.10` per million input tokens, compared to $1.00 for Llama 3.1 405B, and
- `$0.40` per million output tokens, compared to $1.80 for Llama 3.1 405B

In an AI conversation agent example by Databricks, using Llama 3.3 70B is <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/making-ai-more-accessible-80-cost-savings-meta-llama-33-databricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">88% more cost-effective</a> to deploy than Llama 3.1 405B.

## FAQ

### 1. How to finetune Llama 3.3?

Fine-tuning Llama models can be done in two main ways:

1. **Full parameter fine-tuning** by adjusting all model parameters. Best performance, but very time-consuming and GPU-intensive.
2. **Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** using either LoRA or QLoRA.

Meta’s [official fine-tuning guide](https://www.llama.com/docs/how-to-guides/fine-tuning/) recommendeds starting with LoRA fine-tuning. If resources are extremely limited, use QLoRA. Then evaluate model performance after fine-tuning, and only consider full parameter fine-tuning if the results are not satisfactory.

### 2. What data was Llama 3.3 70B trained on?

Llama 3.3 70B was pretrained on 15 trillion tokens from public sources, 7 times larger than Llama 2’s dataset. The training data includes:

- New addition of publicly available online data
- 25+ million synthetically-generated examples for fine-tuning
- 4x more code data than Llama 2
- 5%+ non-English data across 30+ languages

### 3. What is the knowledge cutoff of Llama 3.3 70B?

Llama 3.3 70B has a knowledge cutoff of December 2023.
