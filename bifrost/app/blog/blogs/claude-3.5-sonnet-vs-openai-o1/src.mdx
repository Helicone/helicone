# Comparing Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1 on Coding Tasks

We will now look at some examples of how Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1 perform on generating simple functions, debugging, and writing unit tests.

![Comparing Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1 on Coding Tasks](/static/blog/claude-3.5-sonnet-vs-openai-o1/benchmark-comparisons.webp)

## Example 1: Generating a Simple Function

**Prompt:** Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. The function should handle empty lists and lists containing only one element.

--> <a href="https://copilot.getbind.co/chat/code-generation?query=Write+a+Python+function+that+takes+a+list+of+integers+and+returns+the+sum+of+all+even+numbers+in+the+list.+The+function+should+handle+empty+lists+and+lists+containing+only+one+element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try it with Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>

| Model                 | Observation                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Used a simple loop to iterate through the list, with clear variable names and minimal comments. Clean and straightforward solution.    |
| **OpenAI o1**         | Addressed all the requirements and handled edge cases well (i.e.empty lists and lists with one element). The code was well-structured. |

### Which model performed better?

Claude 3.5 Sonnet provided a simpler and more elegant solution, while OpenAI o1's approach was more thorough with edge case handling.

## Example 2: Debugging Code

**Prompt:** Debug this JavaScript function to remove all vowels from a string.

```
function removeVowels(str) {
  return str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, ");
}
```

→ <a href="https://copilot.getbind.co/chat/code-generation?query=Debug+this+JavaScript+function+to+remove+all+vowels+from+a+string+function+removeVowels(str)+%7B+return+str.replace%28%2F%5Baeiou%5D%2Fgi%2C+%27%27%29%3B+%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try the prompt with GPT-4o</a> (as o1 isn't supported yet)

| Model                 | Observation                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Clearly pinpointed the mistake and provided a straightforward and simple-to-understand solution.                                          |
| **OpenAI o1**         | Quickly identified the issue and offered an efficient solution that addresses the problem directly without adding unnecessary complexity. |

### Which model performed better?

Both models showed strengths in debugging. OpenAI o1 is direct, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet provided a more user-friendly solution. This aligns with reports that o1 excels in complex problem-solving while Claude is preferred for simpler tasks.

## Example 3: Writing Unit Tests

**Prompt:** Develop a set of unit tests for a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes. The function should handle empty lists and lists containing only one element.

→ <a href="https://copilot.getbind.co/chat/code-generation?query=Develop+a+set+of+unit+tests+for+a+function+that+takes+a+list+of+strings+as+input+and+returns+a+new+list+containing+only+the+strings+that+are+palindromes.+The+function+should+handle+empty+lists+and+lists+containing+only+one+element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try the prompt with Claude</a>

| Model                 | Observation                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Produced a comprehensive set of unit tests covering all edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists.                                                   |
| **OpenAI o1**         | o1 also generated a solid set of unit tests, but lacked depth in addressing critical edge cases such as lists with multiple palindrome and non-palindrome strings. |

### Which model performed better?

This test indicates that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is more efficient in generating thorough unit tests, while o1's tests are functional but could be improved.
