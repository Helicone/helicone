![Comparing Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1 on Coding Tasks](/static/blog/claude-3.5-sonnet-vs-openai-o1/benchmark-comparisons.webp)

### Example 1: Generating a Simple Function

**Prompt:** Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list. The function should handle empty lists and lists containing only one element.

--> <a href="https://copilot.getbind.co/chat/code-generation?query=Write+a+Python+function+that+takes+a+list+of+integers+and+returns+the+sum+of+all+even+numbers+in+the+list.+The+function+should+handle+empty+lists+and+lists+containing+only+one+element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try it with Claude 3.5 Sonnet</a>

| Model                 | Observation                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Used a simple loop to iterate through the list, with clear variable names and minimal comments. Clean and straightforward solution.    |
| **OpenAI o1**         | Addressed all the requirements and handled edge cases well (i.e.empty lists and lists with one element). The code was well-structured. |

### Which model performed better?

Claude 3.5 Sonnet provided a simpler and more elegant solution, while OpenAI o1's approach was more thorough with edge case handling.

---

### Example 2: Debugging Code

**Prompt:** Debug this JavaScript function to remove all vowels from a string.

```
function removeVowels(str) {
  return str.replace(/[aeiou]/gi, ");
}
```

→ <a href="https://copilot.getbind.co/chat/code-generation?query=Debug+this+JavaScript+function+to+remove+all+vowels+from+a+string+function+removeVowels(str)+%7B+return+str.replace%28%2F%5Baeiou%5D%2Fgi%2C+%27%27%29%3B+%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try the prompt with GPT-4o</a> (as o1 isn't supported yet)

| Model                 | Observation                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Clearly pinpointed the mistake and provided a straightforward and simple-to-understand solution.                                          |
| **OpenAI o1**         | Quickly identified the issue and offered an efficient solution that addresses the problem directly without adding unnecessary complexity. |

### Which model performed better?

Both models showed strengths in debugging. OpenAI o1 is direct, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet provided a more user-friendly solution. This aligns with reports that o1 excels in complex problem-solving while Claude is preferred for simpler tasks.

### Example 3: Writing Unit Tests

**Prompt:** Develop a set of unit tests for a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing only the strings that are palindromes. The function should handle empty lists and lists containing only one element.

→ <a href="https://copilot.getbind.co/chat/code-generation?query=Develop+a+set+of+unit+tests+for+a+function+that+takes+a+list+of+strings+as+input+and+returns+a+new+list+containing+only+the+strings+that+are+palindromes.+The+function+should+handle+empty+lists+and+lists+containing+only+one+element" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try the prompt with Claude</a>

| Model                 | Observation                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Produced a comprehensive set of unit tests covering all edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists.                                                   |
| **OpenAI o1**         | o1 also generated a solid set of unit tests, but lacked depth in addressing critical edge cases such as lists with multiple palindrome and non-palindrome strings. |

### Which model performed better?

This test indicates that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is more efficient in generating thorough unit tests, while o1's tests are functional but could be improved.
