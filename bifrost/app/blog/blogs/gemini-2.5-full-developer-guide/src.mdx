## Gemini 2.5 Real-World Performance & Reviews

Let's look past the benchmarks and see if Gemini 2.5 Pro can back up those big numbers.

### TL;DR: 
- **Frontend Development**: Excellent at building functional UIs and complex frontends, though generally less aesthetic than the king of aesthetics—Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Code Understanding**: Makes effective use of its massive context window to comprehend entire codebases—perhaps its greatest strength
- **Project Architecture**: Strong at suggesting architectural improvements and feature implementations
- **Reasoning**: Very capable at solving math and problems requiring logical reasoning—significantly outperforming models like Grok 3 and o3-mini.
