LLM applications in production demand strong observability tools. Without them, you're flying blind on costs, performance, and usage patterns.

Both **<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a>** and **<a href="https://portkey.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portkey</a>** offer solutions to this problem, but with different approaches and strengths.

![Helicone vs Portkey: Comparing LLM Observability Platforms](/static/blog/pk-helicone/pk-vs-helicone.webp)

Let's cut through the marketing and compare what each platform actually delivers for developers building with LLMs.

## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone offers dual logging methods

Helicone provides flexibility through **both proxy-based and async logging**. While Portkey only supports proxy-based logging, Helicone lets you choose the approach that fits your architecture:

- **Proxy integration**: Place Helicone between your client and LLM provider for simple one-line integration
- **Async logging**: Use Helicone's SDK for background logging without affecting request flow

This dual approach makes Helicone adaptable to different deployment scenarios.

### 2. Helicone prioritizes business metrics

Helicone's dashboard focuses on **business-relevant metrics** like costs, completion tokens, top models, and user metrics. Portkey's interface tends toward technical metrics like latency and evaluation scores.

Helicone's business focus helps teams understand LLM usage from a practical perspective, making it easier to optimize spending and track ROI.

## Helicone: The Complete LLM Observability

> The ability to test prompt variations on production traffic without touching a line of code is magical. It feels like we're cheating; it's just that good!

— _Helicone user_

![Helicone Dashboard](/static/blog/best-langsmith-alternatives/helicone-dashboard.webp)

Helicone is an <a href="https://github.com/Helicone/helicone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-source</a> observability platform built for cross-functional teams developing production LLM applications. It provides comprehensive metrics and a host of features in a user-friendly interface complete with rich dashboards.

### Key Strengths

- **Flexible integration**: Choose between proxy-based or SDK-based logging
- **Robust experimentation**: UI-driven prompt experiments without code changes
- **Scalability**: Built to handle trillions of LLM interactions effortlessly
- **Advanced security**: Out-of-box integrations with LLM security tools like PromptArmor
- **Evaluation capabilities**: Built-in tools for human and automated evaluations

### Why Developers Choose Helicone

- A balance of simplicity in integration and UI without sacrificing depth of features
- A focus on cost optimization with like caching to reduce LLM spending
- Usable by both technical and non-technical team members
- Flexible integration options (proxy or async logging)

### How to integrate with Helicone

**Example of Proxy integration (1-line setup):**

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
  },
});
```

## Portkey: Gateway-Focused Observability

> With 30 million policies a month, managing over 25 GenAI use cases became a pain. Portkey helped with prompt management, tracking costs per use case, and ensuring our keys were used correctly. 

— _Portkey user_

![Portkey Dashboard](/static/blog/pk-helicone/pk-dash.webp)

Portkey is an LLM observability solution with strong Gateway capabilities—allowing you to integrate multiple providers via a single endpoint. It functions strictly as a proxy, however, but is also suitable cross-functional teams.

### Key Strengths

- **Advanced AI Gateway**: Connect to multiple AI models through a single API with load balancing and routing
- **AI Guardrails**: Extensive options for securing and controlling LLM behavior in real-time 
- **Robust prompt management**: Modular approach to prompt management and reuse with **Prompt Partials**
- **Virtual Keys**: Tools for secure API key management in large teams

### Why Developers Choose Portkey

- Universal API: Single consistent interface for 250+ AI models
- Highly customizable LLM behavior: Comprehensive guardrails system for controlling LLM outputs
- Advanced prompt engineering: Modular prompt architecture with reusable components

### How to Integrate with Portkey

```javascript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  virtualKey: "YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY"
});

async function createChatCompletion() {
  const chat_complete = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
      { role: "user", content: "Hello!" }
    ]
  });
  console.log(chat_complete.choices[0].message.content);
}

createChatCompletion();
```

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

| Feature | Helicone | Portkey |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Dashboard Overview** | More detailed and business-focused with cost metrics, user analytics, and geographic data | Less detailed and more technical with latency, evaluations, and detailed traces |
| **Gateway Capabilities** | Available in beta with basic routing | Core feature with advanced routing, load balancing, and fallbacks |
| **Security Features** | Out-of-box integration with LLM security tools | Custom guardrails requiring more setup |
| **Prompt Management** | Version control and experimentation with UI | Includes unique prompt partials for modular design |
| **OpenTelemetry** | Built on OpenTelemetry | OpenTelemetry-compliant |
| **Alerting** | Built-in alerting features | Built-in alerting features |

## Which platform should you choose?

Both Helicone and Portkey offer robust observability solutions for LLM applications, but they excel in different areas:

### Choose **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone</span>** if you:

- **Need flexible integration options**: Helicone's dual integration approach (proxy or async) gives you architectural flexibility
- **Want highly detailed insights**: Helicone's rich dashboards prioritize cost tracking, user analytics, and other key metrics
- **Have cross-functional teams**: The intuitive UI can be used by both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Prefer UI-based experimentation**: You can test prompt variations through the interface without code changes
- **Value out-of-the-box security and simple third-party app integrations**: Built-in integrations with tools like PromptArmor and PostHog provide additional functionality quickly

### Choose Portkey if you:

- **Need advanced gateway capabilities**: Their routing, load balancing, and fallback systems are more mature
- **Want fine-grained LLM control**: Their comprehensive guardrails system offers detailed control over LLM behavior
- **Need modular prompt components**: Their prompt partials feature offers reusable prompt components

The right choice ultimately depends on your specific use case, team composition, and priorities. 

Both platforms offer free tiers, so you can test them in your environment before committing to either solution.
