LLM applications in production demand strong observability tools. Without them, you're flying blind on costs, performance, and usage patterns.

Both **<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a>** and **<a href="https://portkey.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Portkey</a>** offer solutions to this problem, but with different approaches and strengths. Let's dive in and help you determine which platform is the best fit for your needs.

![Helicone vs Portkey: Comparing LLM Observability Platforms](/static/blog/pk-helicone/pk-vs-helicone.webp)

## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone offers dual logging methods

Helicone provides flexibility through **both proxy-based and async logging**. While Portkey only supports proxy-based logging, Helicone lets you choose the approach that fits your architecture:

- **Proxy integration**: Place Helicone between your client and LLM provider for simple one-line integration
- **Async logging**: Use Helicone's SDK for background logging without affecting request flow

This dual approach makes Helicone adaptable to different deployment scenarios.

### 2. Helicone prioritizes optimization metrics

Helicone's dashboard focuses on **optimization-relevant metrics** like evaluation scores, costs, completion tokens, top models, and user metrics. 

Helicone's detailed metrics help teams understand LLM usage from a practical perspective, making it easier to optimize spending and track ROI.
