![Helicone vs Portkey: Comparing LLM Observability Platforms](/static/blog/pk-helicone/pk-vs-helicone.webp)

LLM applications in production demand strong observability tools. Without them, you're flying blind on costs, performance, and usage patterns.

**[Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai/)** and **[Portkey](https://portkey.ai/)** offer solutions to this problem, but with different approaches and strengths.

Let's cut through the marketing and compare what each platform actually delivers for developers building with LLMs.

## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone offers dual logging methods

Helicone provides flexibility through **both proxy-based and async logging**. While Portkey only supports proxy-based logging, Helicone lets you choose the approach that fits your architecture:

- **Proxy integration**: Place Helicone between your client and LLM provider for simple one-line integration
- **Async logging**: Use Helicone's SDK for background logging without affecting request flow

This dual approach makes Helicone adaptable to different deployment scenarios.

### 2. Helicone prioritizes business metrics

Helicone's dashboard focuses on **business-relevant metrics** like costs, completion tokens, top models, and user metrics. Portkey's interface tends toward technical metrics like latency and evaluation scores.

Helicone's business focus helps teams understand LLM usage from a practical perspective, making it easier to optimize spending and track ROI.

## Helicone: Complete LLM Observability

![Helicone Dashboard](/static/blog/best-langsmith-alternatives/helicone-dashboard.webp)

Helicone is an open-source observability platform built for cross-functional teams developing production LLM applications. It provides comprehensive metrics from both business and technical perspectives.

### Key Strengths

- **Open-source foundation**: Full visibility into the codebase with self-hosting options
- **Flexible integration**: Choose between proxy-based or SDK-based logging
- **Comprehensive analytics**: Business-focused metrics for costs, usage patterns, and user engagement
- **Robust experimentation**: UI-driven prompt experiments without code changes
- **Advanced security**: Out-of-box integrations with LLM security tools like PromptArmor
- **Evaluation capabilities**: Built-in tools for human and automated evaluations

### How to integrate with Helicone

Integration is straightforward with multiple options:

**Proxy integration (One-line setup):**

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
  },
});
```

**SDK integration (Async logging):**

```javascript
import { helicone } from "helicone";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

helicone.init({
  apiKey: process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY,
});

const wrappedOpenAI = helicone.wrap(openai);
```

## Portkey: Gateway-Focused Observability

![Portkey Dashboard](/static/blog/pk-helicone/pk-dash.webp)

Portkey is an LLM observability solution that emphasizes its AI Gateway capabilities. It requires SDK integration and offers a technical-focused dashboard.

### Key Strengths

- **Advanced AI Gateway**: Connect to multiple AI models through a single API with load balancing and routing
- **Customizable guardrails**: Extensive options for controlling LLM behavior in real-time
- **Prompt partials**: Modular approach to prompt management and reuse
- **Technical monitoring**: Detailed technical metrics for latency, evaluation, and tracing
- **Multimodal support**: Handle various data types with AI capabilities

### How Portkey differs from Helicone

While both tools offer LLM observability, key differences include:

- **Integration approach**: Portkey offers proxy integration only, while Helicone offers both proxy and SDK options
- **Gateway focus**: Portkey's AI Gateway is more developed than Helicone's beta version
- **Metric emphasis**: Portkey focuses on technical metrics, while Helicone balances business and technical insights
- **Open-source status**: Helicone is fully open-source, Portkey is not
- **UI approach**: Portkey's interface is more detailed but potentially more intimidating for non-technical users

## Which platform should you choose?

Both platforms offer valuable capabilities for LLM observability, but your specific needs will determine the best fit:

- Choose **Helicone** if you want:
  - Open-source flexibility with self-hosting options
  - Multiple integration methods (proxy or SDK)
  - Business-focused metrics with strong UI for non-technical team members
  - Robust experimentation and evaluation tools

- Choose **Portkey** if you want:
  - Advanced gateway capabilities for routing between multiple models
  - Highly customizable guardrails for LLM behavior control
  - Detailed technical metrics for development teams
  - Modular prompt management with prompt partials

The best choice depends on your team's technical expertise, integration preferences, and whether you prioritize business metrics or technical monitoring.

### Which platform has better gateway features?

Portkey has more advanced gateway features, as this is their core offering. Helicone's gateway is still in beta but functional.

### Which platform has better cost tracking?

Both platforms track costs, but Helicone's dashboard is more focused on business metrics like cost analysis and user-based spending.

### Which platform is better for prompt management?

Both platforms offer strong prompt management. Helicone excels in experimentation, while Portkey offers unique prompt partials for modular prompt design.

### Which platform has better security features?

Helicone offers out-of-box integration with major LLM security tools like PromptArmor. Portkey has customizable guardrails but requires more setup.

### Which platform is better for cross-functional teams?

Helicone's business-focused metrics and UI make it more accessible to non-technical team members, while still providing the technical depth developers need.

### Which platform is more cost-effective?

Helicone has transparent pricing with a generous free tier. Portkey also offers a free tier, but pricing transparency is more limited.
