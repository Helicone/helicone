Let's get into it!

## How is Helicone different?

### 1. Helicone is easy to set up

Helicone is designed to be extremely simple to set up for the cloud offering. The proxy comes with <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" rel="noopener" target="_blank">built-in caching</a>, intuitive <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/experiments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prompt experiments</a> and <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sessions</a> to trace your LLM workflow.

We also try to be as transparent as possible about <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our pricing</a>. Our generous free tier comes with `10k logs/month` and supports integrations with all the major LLM providers. No credit card required.

### 2. Helicone is designed for teams

Helicone is a complete observability tool that supports <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/introducing-helicone-v2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full LLM lifecycle</a>, from logging and experimentation to evaluation and deployment. Helicone is suited for cross-functional teams given the ability to have non-technical members involved in prompt design and evaluation.

<FAQ 
  items={[
    {
      question: "What sets Helicone apart from Braintrust?",
      answer: "Helicone provides a comprehensive observability platform with an intuitive UI, one-line integration, and extensive analytics. It's designed for teams of all sizes and technical backgrounds. Braintrust focuses more narrowly on advanced evaluations with a more technical, code-heavy approach primarily targeting enterprise evaluation use cases."
    },
    {
      question: "Which platform is easier to set up?",
      answer: "Helicone is easier to integrate with its one-line proxy setup or async logging options. Braintrust offers a proxy integration as well with fewer features available than Helicone. For enterprise teams, Braintrust requires more technical knowledge and code to get started. "
    },
    {
      question: "Which platform has better analytics and dashboards?",
      answer: "Helicone offers more detailed, intuitive, and customizable dashboards with a centralized view of key metrics. Braintrust provides less detailed analytics with a more complex UI that has a steeper learning curve."
    },
    {
      question: "How do the pricing models compare?",
      answer: "Helicone offers transparent pricing with several tiers (Free, Pro, Team, Enterprise). Braintrust's pricing is enterprise-focused with custom pricing. Both platforms have feature usage limits in the free tier."
    },
    {
      question: "Which tool is better for reducing costs?",
      answer: "Helicone provides better cost optimization tools. While they both support caching, Helicone takes things a step further with rate limits and in-depth cost analytics for better decision-making."
    },
    {
      question: "Which platform has better prompt management and experimentation?",
      answer: "Both platforms offer robust prompt management and experimentation capabilities. Helicone's strength is in its UI-driven approach that makes it accessible to non-technical team members. Braintrust offers powerful experimentation features but requires more technical knowledge to use effectively."
    },
    {
      question: "Which platform offers better security features?",
      answer: "Helicone provides more robust security features out-of-the-box, including API key management and LLM security to prevent prompt injections. Braintrust offers fewer built-in security capabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "How do the integrations compare?",
      answer: "Helicone supports a wider range of integrations with LLM providers with its gateway integration. Braintrust offers over 100 providers, but not all."
