## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What sets Helicone apart from Braintrust?**

   **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone offers a broader feature set</span>** tailored for scalability and comprehensive observability, including advanced analytics with detailed cost breakdowns and performance metrics. While it lacks built-in advanced evaluations (coming soon), it allows teams to post custom evaluation results via its API. Braintrust focuses primarily on advanced evaluations and CI/CD integration but lacks a dashboard and advanced analytics.

2. **Do I need to use another evaluation platform with Helicone?**

   Currently, Helicone does not have built-in advanced evaluation features (they are coming soon). Many teams create their own bespoke evaluations and post the results to Helicone's API, leveraging its data aggregation and analytics capabilities.

3. **Is Braintrust suitable for large-scale applications?**

   Likely not on its own. Braintrust lacks the scalability features and advanced analytics crucial for handling high-volume LLM usage and in-depth analysis.

4. **Which platform is more cost-effective?**

   Helicone offers **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>transparent and flexible pricing with a generous free tier</span>**, supporting small teams to enterprise. Braintrust's enterprise pricing is non-transparent, which could lead to unexpected costs.

5. **Can I self-host these platforms?**

   **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone is open-source</span>**, allowing for self-hosting and greater control. Braintrust does not offer an open-source option.
