Picture this: You've spent weeks crafting the perfect LLM application, only to find your carefully engineered prompts producing inconsistent results in production. One day they work flawlessly, the next they generate nonsensical responses. Sound familiar? This is the reality for many developers working with LLMs, where prompt reliability can make or break an application's success.

![Prompt evalution frameworks blog cover](/static/blog/prompt-evaluation-frameworks/cover.webp)

Prompt evaluation frameworks are tools and methodologies designed to assess and optimize the effectiveness of prompts used with large language models (LLMs). They enable developers to systematically test, refine, and benchmark prompts to achieve desired outputs.

## Why Should You Evaluate Your Prompt?

As LLM applications grow more complex, prompt management and monitoring become crucial challenges for developers. Here are several pain points when working with LLMs, which make prompt evaluation frameworks a necessity:

### 1. Ineffective Prompt Engineering

Creating precise prompts is often trial and error. Developers often need to extensively test and refine prompts to optimize them for specific tasks, requiring repeated adjustments for consistent results.

### 2. Inconsistent and Unreliable Outputs

LLMs can generate incorrect or irrelevant responses, known as hallucinations. These issues reduce the reliability of outputs, requiring ongoing prompt adjustments.

### 3. Output Formatting Issues

LLMs sometimes fail to deliver responses in the desired format, such as structured data or specific code syntax, leading to wasted time on manual corrections.

### 4. Managing Long-Form Content

LLMs struggle to maintain coherence and context in long outputs, particularly near token limits. Developers frequently use techniques like chunking or context windowing. Prompt evaluation frameworks assist in testing and optimizing these methods, enabling better handling of extended content while preserving context and quality.

### 5. Lack of Specialized Tools for Prompt Testing

There is a growing need for dedicated tools to test, refine, and manage prompts. Such tools would streamline prompt evaluation, improving output quality and reducing iteration time.

## Key Metrics

When evaluating prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), developers commonly focus on these key metrics:

- **Output Accuracy**: Measures the correctness of the model’s response relative to the desired answer.
- **Relevance**: Assesses how pertinent the output is to the given prompt.
- **Coherence**: Evaluates the logical consistency and clarity of the response.
- **Format Adherence**: Checks if the output aligns with the specified format, such as JSON or code syntax.
- **Latency**: Measures the time taken for the model to generate a response.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Evaluates the computational resources required for prompt execution.

       # Add more dataset items as needed
   ]
   ```

6. **Define the Evaluation Task**:

   Create a function that processes each dataset item, generates the LLM response, and prepares the data for scoring:

   ```python
   def evaluation_task(item):
       input_prompt = item["input"]
       expected_output = item["expected_output"]
       generated_output = generate_response(input_prompt)
       return {
           "input": input_prompt,
           "output": generated_output,
           "expected_output": expected_output
       }
   ```

   Utilize the `evaluate` function to process the dataset with the defined task and metrics:

   ```python
   from opik.evaluation import evaluate

   results = evaluate(
       dataset=dataset,
       task=evaluation_task,
       scoring_metrics=[hallucination_metric],
       experiment_name="Prompt Evaluation Experiment",
       project_name="LLM Evaluation Project"
   )
   ```

8. **Review the Results**:

   After execution, analyze the evaluation results to understand your LLM's performance:

   ```python
   for result in results:
       print(f"Prompt: {result['input']}")
       print(f"Generated Output: {result['output']}")
       print(f"Hallucination Score: {result['scores']['hallucination']}")
       print("-" * 50)
   ```

### **Basic Setup for Evals**

To perform prompt evaluation using Braintrust's SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Braintrust SDK:**

   
   ```bash
   npm install braintrust autoevals
   ```
2. **Define an evaluation script:**

    The evaluation script specifies your dataset, the task (such as an LLM call), and scoring functions to assess the outputs. Here's an example in TypeScript:

    ```typescript
    import { Eval } from "braintrust";
    import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";

    Eval(
        "Say Hi Bot", // Replace with your project name
        {
            data: () => [
                { input: "Alice", expected: "Hi Alice" },
                { input: "Bob", expected: "Hi Bob" },
            ],
        task: async (input) => {
        // Replace this with your LLM call
        return "Hi " + input;
        },
        scores: [Levenshtein],
        }
    );
    ```

    In this script:

    - `data` provides the evaluation dataset, each with an `input` and an `expected` output.

    - `task` defines the function to be evaluated; here, it concatenates "Hi " with the input name. Replace this with your LLM call.

    - `scores` includes scoring functions to evaluate the output; `Levenshtein` measures the similarity between the actual and expected outputs.

This setup allows you to assess how well your model's outputs align with expectations, facilitating prompt evaluation and model refinement. For more detailed information, refer to Braintrust's [Eval SDK Documentation](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/start/eval-sdk).


## Choosing the Right Prompt Evaluation Framework

To choose the best prompt evaluation framework for your needs, consider the following criteria:

1. **Core Features**: Ensure it supports prompt testing, monitoring, versioning, and management. Example: Helicone offers monitoring and cost tracking.
	
2. **Integration**: Look for compatibility with your existing tools (CI/CD pipelines, LLM APIs). Example: PromptLayer integrates with OpenAI APIs.

3. **Scalability**: Assess its ability to handle large-scale prompt evaluations and datasets.

4. **Metrics Support**: Verify it tracks key metrics like accuracy, relevance, latency, and cost.

5. **Usability**: Check for an intuitive UI, detailed documentation, and automation capabilities.

6. **Community & Support**: Opt for frameworks with active communities or strong customer support for troubleshooting.
