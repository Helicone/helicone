Picture this: You've spent weeks crafting the perfect LLM application, only to find your carefully engineered prompts producing inconsistent results in production.

One day they work flawlessly, the next they generate nonsensical responses. Sound familiar? This is the reality for many developers working with LLMs, where prompt reliability can make or break an application's success.

![Prompt evaluation frameworks blog cover](/static/blog/prompt-evaluation-frameworks/eval-cover.webp)

Prompt evaluation frameworks are designed to address the challenges of working with LLMs. They enable developers to systematically test, refine, and benchmark prompts to achieve desired outputs. In this blog, we will compare the leading prompt evaluation frameworks, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

Ready to get started? Let's dive in!

| Framework   | Pricing Model         |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Helicone    | Freemium, Open-source |
| OpenAI Eval | Freemium              |
| Promptfoo   | Freemium, Open-source |
| Comet Opik  | Freemium, Open-source |
| PromptLayer | Freemium              |
| Traceloop   | Freemium, Open-source |
| Braintrust  | Freemium              |

## Why should you evaluate your prompts?

- **Ineffective prompt engineering.** Crafting effective prompts often requires trial and error. You need to use <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt engineering techniques</a> to guide the model towards the desired response. This is quite a manual process and is not a guarantee of consistent results.

- **LLMs can be unpredictable.** LLMs can generate incorrect or irrelevant responses (a.k.a. hallucinate) despite the best efforts of prompt engineering. When you switch a model, adjust parameters, or make a small change to the prompt, the output can change dramatically.

- **Output formatting issues.** Sometimes, LLMs fail to return outputs in the desired format, such as JSON or specific code syntax. This can be a huge issues when <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/ai-agent-builders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building agentic workflows</a> where the input of the following function depend on previously returned outputs.

- **Managing long-form content.** LLMs struggle to maintain coherence and context in long outputs, particularly near token limits. Developers frequently use techniques like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/chunking-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chunking</a> to handle this. Prompt evaluation frameworks help in testing and optimizing your prompts while preserving context and quality.

- **Lack of specialized tools for prompt testing.** There is a growing need for dedicated tools to test, refine, and manage prompts. Such tools would streamline prompt evaluation, improving output quality and reducing iteration time.

## Key metrics for evaluating prompt effectiveness

When evaluating prompts for Large Language Models, developers usually focus on the following key metrics:

| Metric               | What it measures                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Output Accuracy**  | The correctness of the model's response relative to the desired answer     |
| **Relevance**        | How pertinent the output is to the given prompt                            |
| **Coherence**        | The logical consistency and clarity of the response                        |
| **Format Adherence** | Whether the output follows the specified format (i.e. JSON or code syntax) |
| **Latency**          | The time taken for the model to generate a response                        |
| **Cost Efficiency**  | The computational resources required for prompt execution                  |

To evaluate prompts using Traceloop, you can utilize their SDK to manage and fetch prompts within your application. Here's how to implement it:

1. **Install the Traceloop SDK**

   Ensure the SDK is installed in your environment:

   ```bash
   pip install traceloop-sdk
   ```

2. **Initialize Traceloop in Your Application**

   Import and initialize Traceloop with your application name:

   ```python
   from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop
   Traceloop.init(app_name="your_app_name", traceloop_sync_enabled=True)
   ```

   Setting `traceloop_sync_enabled=True` enables prompt synchronization.

3. **Fetch and Use Prompts from Traceloop**

   Retrieve managed prompts using the `get_prompt` function:

   ```python
   prompt_template = Traceloop.get_prompt("joke_generator")
   ```

   This fetches the prompt associated with the key `"joke_generator"`.

4. **Incorporate the Prompt into Your LLM Workflow**

   Use the fetched prompt in your LLM application:

   ```python
   def create_prompt(prompt_template, question):
       return prompt_template.format(question=question)
   prompt = create_prompt(prompt_template, "Why did the chicken cross the road?")
   response = llm.generate(prompt)
   ```

   This approach allows you to manage and evaluate prompts effectively within your application.

{/* ### **What is Braintrust?** */}

{/* Braintrust is an end-to-end platform for building AI applications. It makes software development with large language models (LLMs) robust and iterative. It allows you to create prompts, test them out in the playground, use them in your code, update them, and track their performance over time. */}

### Key Features

- **Iterative LLM Workflows:** Enables continuous refinement of AI prompts and models, enhancing product reliability by diagnosing regressions and optimizing performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Offers tools to analyze LLM execution traces, providing insights into AI interactions to maintain optimal model performance.
- **Custom Scoring Mechanism:** Allows developers to define scoring criteria in natural language or code, facilitating precise evaluation of LLM outputs against expected results.
- **Integrated Dataset Management:** Enables efficient capture and organization of rated example datasets, allowing the creation of scalable and secure "golden" datasets for training AI models.

### Differentiators

- **Hill Climbing:** Supports iterative improvement by comparing new experiments to previous ones, even without pre-existing benchmarks, aiding in model performance enhancement.
- **Trials:** Allows running each input multiple times to assess variance in responses, providing a more robust overall score through intelligent aggregation of results.
- **Model Comparison:** Facilitates evaluation across multiple AI models and parameters, assisting in informed model selection and optimization.

### Basic Setup

1.  **Install the Braintrust SDK**

    ```bash
    npm install braintrust autoevals
    ```

2.  **Define an evaluation script**

    The evaluation script specifies your dataset, the task (such as an LLM call), and scoring functions to assess the outputs. Here's an example in TypeScript:

    ```typescript
    import { Eval } from "braintrust";
    import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";
    Eval(
      "Say Hi Bot", // Replace with your project name
      {
        data: () => [
          { input: "Alice", expected: "Hi Alice" },
          { input: "Bob", expected: "Hi Bob" },
        ],
        task: async (input) => {
          // Replace this with your LLM call
          return "Hi " + input;
        },
        scores: [Levenshtein],
      }
    );
    ```

    In this script:

    - `data` specifies the evaluation dataset, with an `input`/`expected` output.
    - `task` defines the function to be evaluated; here, it concatenates "Hi " with the input name. Replace this with your LLM call.
    - `scores` includes scoring functions to evaluate the output; `Levenshtein` measures the similarity between the actual and expected outputs.

This setup allows you to assess how well your model's outputs align with expectations. For more detailed information, refer to Braintrust's <a href="https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/start/eval-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eval SDK documentation</a>.
