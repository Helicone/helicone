As an AI engineer, you've likely spent weeks perfecting your LLM application, realizing that your carefully engineered prompts start producing inconsistent results in production. What worked perfectly in testing now generates unexpected outputs, and you're left wondering what changed. Sounds familiar?

![Prompt evaluation frameworks blog cover](/static/blog/prompt-evaluation-frameworks/eval-cover.webp)

This is the reality for many developers working with LLMs. While LLMs can perform impressive feats of natural language processing, their output quality heavily depends on how effectively we communicate with them through prompts.

Today, the most impactful thing you can do to improve your LLM application is to create high quality evaluations to measure your prompts. Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand how different model or prompt changes affect your output.

In this blog, we will compare the leading prompt evaluation frameworks available today, helping you choose the right tool for your specific needs. We will cover:

- **Why evaluate your prompts?**
- **Key metrics for evaluating prompt effectiveness**

Let's dive in!

## Why evaluate your prompts?

Prompt evaluation frameworks help developers systematically test, refine, and benchmark prompts to achieve desired outputs. Key challenges include:

- **Ineffective prompt engineering.** Crafting effective prompts often requires trial and error. You need to use <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt engineering techniques</a> to guide the model towards the desired response. This is quite a manual process and is not a guarantee of consistent results, unless you test it regularly.

- **Unpredictable LLM outputs.** LLMs can hallucinate and generate incorrect responses, even with good prompts. Changes to models, parameters, or prompts can significantly impact outputs, requiring active monitoring.

- **Issue with output formatting.** Sometimes, LLMs fail to return outputs in the desired format (e.g. JSON, code), breaking <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/ai-agent-builders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agentic workflows</a> that depend on structured responses.

- **Managing long-form content.** LLMs often lose coherence in long outputs near token limits. Developers use <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/chunking-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chunking techniques</a> and prompt evaluation frameworks to preserve quality and context.

- **Lack of specialized tools for prompt testing.** There is a growing need for dedicated tools to test, refine, and manage prompts. Such tools would streamline prompt evaluation, improving output quality and reducing iteration time.

## Key metrics for evaluating prompt effectiveness

When evaluating prompts for Large Language Models, developers usually focus on the following key metrics:

| Metric               | What it measures                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Output Accuracy**  | The correctness of the model's response relative to the desired answer     |
| **Relevance**        | How pertinent the output is to the given prompt                            |
| **Coherence**        | The logical consistency and clarity of the response                        |
| **Format Adherence** | Whether the output follows the specified format (i.e. JSON or code syntax) |
| **Latency**          | The time taken for the model to generate a response                        |
| **Cost Efficiency**  | The computational resources required for prompt execution                  |

- **Efficient Error Detection:** Employs innovative methods to identify issues like hallucinations without relying on additional LLMs, enhancing resource efficiency.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Integrates with numerous models, frameworks, and vector databases, providing developers with flexibility and comprehensive visibility into their LLM applications.

### Basic Setup

To evaluate prompts using Traceloop, you can utilize their SDK to manage and fetch prompts within your application. Here's how to implement it:

1. **Install the Traceloop SDK**

   Ensure the SDK is installed in your environment:

   ```bash
   pip install traceloop-sdk
   ```

2. **Initialize Traceloop in Your Application**

   Import and initialize Traceloop with your application name:

   ```python
   from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop
   Traceloop.init(app_name="your_app_name", traceloop_sync_enabled=True)
   ```

   Setting `traceloop_sync_enabled=True` enables prompt synchronization.

3. **Fetch and Use Prompts from Traceloop**

   Retrieve managed prompts using the `get_prompt` function:

   ```python
   prompt_template = Traceloop.get_prompt("joke_generator")
   ```

   This fetches the prompt associated with the key `"joke_generator"`.

4. **Incorporate the Prompt into Your LLM Workflow**

   Use the fetched prompt in your LLM application:

   ```python
   def create_prompt(prompt_template, question):
       return prompt_template.format(question=question)
   prompt = create_prompt(prompt_template, "Why did the chicken cross the road?")
   response = llm.generate(prompt)
   ```

   This approach allows you to manage and evaluate prompts effectively within your application.

### What is Braintrust?

Braintrust is an end-to-end platform for building AI applications. It makes software development with LLMs robust and iterative. It allows you to create prompts, test them out in the playground, use them in your code, update them, and track their performance over time.

### Key Features

- **Iterative LLM Workflows:** Enables continuous refinement of AI prompts and models, enhancing product reliability by diagnosing regressions and optimizing performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Offers tools to analyze LLM execution traces, providing insights into AI interactions to maintain optimal model performance.
- **Custom Scoring Mechanism:** Allows developers to define scoring criteria in natural language or code, facilitating precise evaluation of LLM outputs against expected results.
- **Integrated Dataset Management:** Enables efficient capture and organization of rated example datasets, allowing the creation of scalable and secure "golden" datasets for training AI models.

### Differentiators

- **Hill Climbing:** Supports iterative improvement by comparing new experiments to previous ones, even without pre-existing benchmarks, aiding in model performance enhancement.
- **Trials:** Allows running each input multiple times to assess variance in responses, providing a more robust overall score through intelligent aggregation of results.
- **Model Comparison:** Facilitates evaluation across multiple AI models and parameters, assisting in informed model selection and optimization.

### Basic Setup

1.  **Install the Braintrust SDK**

    ```bash
    npm install braintrust autoevals
    ```

2.  **Define an evaluation script**

    The evaluation script specifies your dataset, the task (such as an LLM call), and scoring functions to assess the outputs. Here's an example in TypeScript:

    ```typescript
    import { Eval } from "braintrust";
    import { Levenshtein } from "autoevals";
    Eval(
      "Say Hi Bot", // Replace with your project name
      {
        data: () => [
          { input: "Alice", expected: "Hi Alice" },
          { input: "Bob", expected: "Hi Bob" },
        ],
        task: async (input) => {
          // Replace this with your LLM call
          return "Hi " + input;
        },
        scores: [Levenshtein],
      }
    );
    ```

    In this script:

    - `data` specifies the evaluation dataset, with an `input`/`expected` output.
    - `task` defines the function to be evaluated; here, it concatenates "Hi " with the input name. Replace this with your LLM call.
    - `scores` includes scoring functions to evaluate the output; `Levenshtein` measures the similarity between the actual and expected outputs.

This setup allows you to assess how well your model's outputs align with expectations. For more detailed information, refer to Braintrust's <a href="https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/start/eval-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eval SDK documentation</a>.

## Choosing the Right Prompt Evaluation Framework

The best prompt evaluation framework vary depending on your needs. Here are a few things you should consider:

1. **Core features**: Determine whether you need a tool solely for prompt evaluation or a comprehensive platform for LLM app optimization. All-in-one observability and evaluation solutions include Helicone, Comet, and Braintrust.

2. **Integration**: Make sure the framework of choice is compatible with your existing tools, including CI/CD pipelines and LLM APIs. While OpenAI Evals is limited to OpenAI APIs, platforms like Helicone and PromptLayer offer broader integration with providers such as Claude, Gemini, and Llama.

3. **Scalability**: For production-scale evaluations, choose a tool that can handle large datasets and high-volume prompt evaluations efficiently.

4. **Metrics Support**: Verify that the framework allows you to run the evaluation of choice. Some platforms only support LLM-as-a-judge, while others allow you to define custom evaluators.

5. **Usability**: If you are looking for a solution for your team with mixed technical experience, consider choosing a platform with intuitive UI and detailed documentation.

## Bottom Line

As LLMs become increasingly central to modern applications, prompt evaluation frameworks have evolved from simple testing tools into comprehensive platforms for managing, monitoring, and optimizing AI interactions.

Whether you choose an open-source solution like Helicone or a commercial platform like PromptLayer, these frameworks are essential for building reliable, production-grade LLM applications that consistently deliver value to end users.
