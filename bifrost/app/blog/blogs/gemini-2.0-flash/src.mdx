**What distinguishes Gemini 2.0 is its advanced reasoning process**. The <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode?_gl=1*af5obp*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTczOTkzMjk4NC4xNzM0NzU5MDQx*_ga_P1DBVKWT6V*MTczNDc1OTA0MS4xLjAuMTczNDc1OTA0MS4wLjAuNzg3ODIzODc1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thinking Mode</a> provides strong reasoning capabilities than the base model Gemini 2.0 Flash, which significantly reduces model hallucinations and improves the accuracy of the model's responses.

## Key Features of Gemini 2.0

### New Multimodal Capabilities

Like previous models, Gemini 2.0 Flash supports multi-modal inputs (text, images, audio and video). The new model now introduced **multimodal outputs** that allows the generation of responses with text, audio, and images through <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/the-next-chapter-of-the-gemini-era-for-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a single API call</a>, making it a versatile model for a wider range of applications.

### Advanced Reasoning = Better Performance

Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Mode provides **advanced reasoning** allows it to analyze complex tasks, think multiple steps ahead, and provide results that are <a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1869798307343806827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">more accurate and context-aware</a> than top models like OpenAI o1. This makes Gemini 2.0 more ideal for use cases where deeper analysis is required, like AI-powered research assistants and complex query handling.

### Integration with Native & External Tools

Developers will appreciate the new <a href="https://ai.google.dev/api/multimodal-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multimodal Live API</a>, which allows Gemini 2.0 to integrate in real-time with native tools like Google Search, Maps, and <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/the-next-chapter-of-the-gemini-era-for-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code execution</a>, as well as custom third-party functions via function calling.

This integration makes Gemini 2.0 a valuable tool for tasks that require dynamic, real-time data from multiple sources, such as real-time media analysis or live decision-making based on current data.

### Improved Developer Experience

Developers can integrate pretrained models like Gemini 2.0 into their projects easily using Google AI Studio and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vertex AI</a>. Tools like **Gemini Code Assist** for programming tasks and **Google Colab** integrations with Gemini's capabilities are examples of how Google is making AI more accessible for developers.

## Gemini 2.0 Benchmarks: Performance and Speed

Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash has been specifically designed for speed and performance. According to early <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gemini-2-0-flash-experimental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmarks</a>, Gemini 2.0 Flash performs twice as fast as its predecessor, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and matches top models like <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o1-and-chatgpt-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI o1</a> and <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/meta-llama-3-3-70-b-instruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Llama 3.3 70b</a>. Gemini 2.0 also significantly improved time to first token (TTFT) compared to Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Moreover, Gemini 2.0 is expected to become widely available to users in early 2025. Google has already started limited testing of Gemini 2.0 in <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-ai-collection-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Overviews for Search</a> in December 2024. The broader rollout of Gemini 2.0 to Google Search and other Google products is planned for early 2025.

## How Gemini 2.0 Compares to Its Predecessors

When <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/#gemini-2-0-flash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparing Gemini 2.0</a> with previous iterations, there are several notable improvements:

- **Speed and Performance**: As mentioned, Gemini 2.0 Flash is notably faster than its predecessors, offering improved response times for developers and users.
- **Multimodal Support**: The added multimodal input and output capabilities sets Gemini 2.0 apart from earlier versions that only handled text.
- **Agentic Features**: While Gemini 1.0 and 1.5 models could respond to text-based prompts, Gemini 2.0 can handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

![Google Gemini 2.0 Flash - Benchmarks](/static/blog/gemini-2.0-flash/gemini-2.0-benchmark.webp)

These upgrades make Gemini 2.0 not just a tool for developers but also a potential game-changer in industries like **healthcare, finance, and gaming**, where decision-making, multi-step reasoning, and real-time data interaction are vital.

## Where to Access Gemini 2.0

As of now, an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 is available to developers and trusted testers. Google has already begun integrating it into several of its products and services, including Google Search, and through the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/?utm_source=gfd&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog-dec&utm_content=gemini2-L0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/studio/freeform?model=gemini-2.0-flash-exp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vertex AI</a>.

For those interested in exploring Gemini 2.0’s capabilities, Google is offering free access through AI Studio, where developers can experiment with the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/multimodal-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multimodal live API</a> and other advanced features.

Developers can access the model in code by using `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp` or `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219`.

## Integrate Gemini 2.0 Flash with Helicone ⚡️

Integrate LLM observability with a few lines of code. See <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/gemini/api/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a> for details.

```javascript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel(
  {
    model: "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp",
  },
  requestOptions = {
    customHeaders: new Headers({
      "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
      "Helicone-Target-URL": `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`,
    }),
    baseUrl: "https://gateway.helicone.ai",
  } as RequestOptions
);
```

## Limitations

### People and Image Editing Restrictions

Generating images of people or editing uploaded images of individuals is prohibited. This is to ensure privacy and respect for all users, maintaining a standard of ethics in image creation.

### Optimized Language Support

For optimal performance in image generation, it’s best to use specific languages such as English (EN), Spanish (es-MX), Japanese (ja-JP), Chinese (zh-CN), and Hindi (hi-IN). These languages are supported with the highest accuracy and fluency for the best results.

### Audio and Video Limitations

Please note that audio or video inputs are not supported for image generation. The focus remains on creating visual content based on textual prompts only.

### Image Generation Challenges

Sometimes, image generation might not trigger as expected, and there are a few things you can try:

- If the model outputs text instead of an image, try explicitly asking for an image in your prompt (e.g., “generate an image” or “please provide images as you go along”).
- On some occasions, the model may stop generating an image halfway through. If this happens, kindly attempt the request again or modify your prompt slightly to get the desired output.

## What's Next for Google Gemini?

Looking ahead, Google’s vision for Gemini 2.0 is centered around making AI more "agentic"—being able to take actions on behalf of users. This concept has evolved from previous "assistant" models, where AI was used primarily for answering questions and providing insights. Now with Gemini 2.0, the goal is to create models that can handle more practical, action-oriented tasks, such as planning a trip, completing programming tasks, or interacting with other software tools.

In line with this, Google is developing Project Astra, a research initiative exploring the potential of a universal AI assistant. Similar to J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man films, this assistant would be able to understand a vast array of contexts, handle complex tasks, and assist users in real-time.
