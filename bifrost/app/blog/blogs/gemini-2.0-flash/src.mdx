## Limitations

### People and Image Editing Restrictions

Generating images of people or editing uploaded images of individuals is prohibited. This is to ensure privacy and respect for all users, maintaining a standard of ethics in image creation.

### Optimized Language Support

For optimal performance in image generation, it’s best to use specific languages such as English (EN), Spanish (es-MX), Japanese (ja-JP), Chinese (zh-CN), and Hindi (hi-IN). These languages are supported with the highest accuracy and fluency for the best results.

### Audio and Video Limitations

Please note that audio or video inputs are not supported for image generation. The focus remains on creating visual content based on textual prompts only.

### Image Generation Challenges

Sometimes, image generation might not trigger as expected, and there are a few things you can try:

- If the model outputs text instead of an image, try explicitly asking for an image in your prompt (e.g., “generate an image” or “please provide images as you go along”).
- On some occasions, the model may stop generating an image halfway through. If this happens, kindly attempt the request again or modify your prompt slightly to get the desired output.

# How to Build Reliable LLM Applications with Gemini 2.0

When building an LLM application, especially with new models or switching from one model to another, it’s important to monitor AI responses to ensure consistent performance for your end-users. We recommend:

### Step 1. Setting up an LLM observability and monitoring tool

Start by choosing an observability tool. <a href="https://helicone.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helicone</a> is easy to set up and free to start. Next, <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/gemini/api/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integrate</a> your Gemini-powered AI app. If you choose to use Helicone, this step takes about a minute.

(show listing for events)

Once you've integrated your Gemini-powered AI app, you can start monitoring your model's response time, latency and costs in real time.

(Show dashboard)

### Step 2. Monitor usage, analyze user behaviors and evaluate model outputs

Analyze your user behavior patterns regularly. You can gain some insights through user feedback or by reviewing your logs. In Helicone, all your logs are filterable in the `Request` tab.

You can filter by errors or by other custom properties like **user segment**, **environment**, or **session ID** to get more granular insights, identify opportunities and performance bottlenecks to know if you should improve your prompt, cut down API costs, or improve speed - just to name a few.

### Step 3. Tweak your prompt

As LLMs are sensitive to model and prompt changes, use Helicone's Experiments feature to test and compare different versions of your prompts to see which version improves the output, or if the new changes you made will cause performance regressions.

Use Helicone’s dashboard to monitor your model’s response time, latency and costs in real time. <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/integrations/gemini/api/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrating your Gemini app</a> only takes a few seconds and 2 lines of code.

### Step 4. Push new changes to production

Once you are happy with your changes, you can push your new changes to production.

(show dashboard)

### Step 5. Rinse and repeat (from Step 2)

A continuous improvement cycle is key to building a reliable LLM application. **Keep monitoring your model's performance & improving your prompts to make sure your application is always performing at its best.**

# What's Next for Google's AI?

Looking ahead, Google’s vision for Gemini 2.0 is centered around making AI more "agentic"—being able to take actions on behalf of users. This concept has evolved from previous "assistant" models, where AI was used primarily for answering questions and providing insights. Now with Gemini 2.0, the goal is to create models that can handle more practical, action-oriented tasks, such as planning a trip, completing programming tasks, or interacting with other software tools.

In line with this, Google is developing Project Astra, a research initiative exploring the potential of a universal AI assistant. Similar to J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man films, this assistant would be able to understand a vast array of contexts, handle complex tasks, and assist users in real-time.
