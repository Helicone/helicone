## Limitations

### People and Image Editing Restrictions

Generating images of people or editing uploaded images of individuals is prohibited. This is to ensure privacy and respect for all users, maintaining a standard of ethics in image creation.

### Optimized Language Support

For optimal performance in image generation, it’s best to use specific languages such as English (EN), Spanish (es-MX), Japanese (ja-JP), Chinese (zh-CN), and Hindi (hi-IN). These languages are supported with the highest accuracy and fluency for the best results.

### Audio and Video Limitations

Please note that audio or video inputs are not supported for image generation. The focus remains on creating visual content based on textual prompts only.

### Image Generation Challenges

Sometimes, image generation might not trigger as expected, and there are a few things you can try:

- If the model outputs text instead of an image, try explicitly asking for an image in your prompt (e.g., “generate an image” or “please provide images as you go along”).
- On some occasions, the model may stop generating an image halfway through. If this happens, kindly attempt the request again or modify your prompt slightly to get the desired output.

## Where to Access Gemini 2.0

As of now, an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 is available to developers and trusted testers. Google has already begun integrating it into several of its products and services, including Google Search, and through the Gemini API in <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/?utm_source=gfd&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog-dec&utm_content=gemini2-L0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Google AI Studio</a> and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/studio/freeform?model=gemini-2.0-flash-exp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vertex AI</a>.

## What's next for Google's AI?

Looking ahead, Google’s vision for Gemini 2.0 is centered around making AI more "agentic"—being able to take actions on behalf of users. This concept has evolved from previous "assistant" models, where AI was used primarily for answering questions and providing insights. Now with Gemini 2.0, the goal is to create models that can handle more practical, action-oriented tasks, such as planning a trip, completing programming tasks, or interacting with other software tools.

In line with this, Google is developing Project Astra, a research initiative exploring the potential of a universal AI assistant. Similar to J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man films, this assistant would be able to understand a vast array of contexts, handle complex tasks, and assist users in real-time.
