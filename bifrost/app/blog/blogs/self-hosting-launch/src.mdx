![Announcing Helicone Self-Hosting](/static/blog/self-hosting-launch/thumbanail.webp)

You love Helicone's insights into your LLM usage, but your security team doesn't love sending sensitive data to third-party servers.

Today, we're bridging that gap with **Helicone Self-Hosting** — the same powerful observability platform you rely on, now deployable inside your own infrastructure with a [single Docker command](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/self-host/docker).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Helicone/helicone.git

cd helicone/docker

# See your Helicone dashboard in localhost:3000!
./helicone-compose.sh helicone up
```

## **When Compliance Meets Innovation**

You've built incredible AI applications. Helicone's observability platform has been essential for tracking usage, optimizing costs, and improving performance.

But as your applications handle increasingly sensitive data, your security and compliance teams have raised valid concerns:

- Customer financial records can't leave your infrastructure
- Patient healthcare data must remain HIPAA-compliant
- Intellectual property in prompts needs protection
- Regulated industries have strict data residency requirements

While [67%](https://springsapps.com/knowledge/large-language-model-statistics-and-numbers-2024) of organizations are now using LLM solutions, those in regulated industries face significant barriers to implementation because of data privacy concerns.

You shouldn't have to choose between powerful observability and compliance. Now you don't have to.

## Data Sovereignty in AI Monitoring

We have offered a self-hosting option ever since we launched two years ago - but it has become clear we needed a simpler set up.

After a month of engineering work, **we reduced twelve containers into four** and made it incredibly easy to clone, compose, deploy, and scale.

## Why Self-Hosted LLM Observability Is Key for Compliance-Focused Organizations

**Self-hosted LLM observability** offers enhanced security, flexible customization, greater control over data, and potential cost savings compared to other cloud-hosted solutions.

By self-hosting your own observability tools, you are able to manage your own infrastructure and store your own data - ensuring sensitive information remains within your control.

For security-conscious corporations, the benefits of **open source AI observability** are clear.

### 1. Complete Data Sovereignty

Keep all LLM interactions, prompt data, and analytics entirely within your security perimeter.

Healthcare organizations processing patient data can maintain HIPAA compliance while still leveraging powerful AI capabilities with comprehensive **LLM monitoring**.

Host both your tools and data within your infrastructure, integrated to your existing systems, and secured by your own engineering team.

### 2. Protection of Intellectual Property

When your [prompt engineering](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools) represents significant competitive advantage, **self-hosted LLM observability** ensures proprietary prompts never leave your infrastructure.

Especially when hosting your own fine-tuned models, protect your intellectual property by owning your requests, responses, usage-based tracking, and prompt engineering secrets.

### 3. Customized Integration

Governance-focused conglomerates often have unique security protocols and existing software ecosystems.

Our **open source LLM observability** platform seamlessly integrates with your internal SSO, logging systems, and existing dashboards so you don't have to change a thing internally.

### 4. Cost Efficiency at Scale

For protocol-driven companies processing millions of LLM requests daily, the economics of running your own **AI observability** stack become increasingly favorable compared to per-request pricing models.

## What Self-Hosted LLM Observability Looks Like in Practice

Here's how data-sovereign **LLM monitoring** works with Helicone Self-Hosting:

1. Your application generates an LLM request
2. Your self-hosted Helicone platform logs and monitors the request within your secured infrastructure
3. Your product and analytics teams gain valuable insights without data ever leaving your control

Each component of this **open source AI observability** solution operates entirely within your security perimeter and infrastructure.

## Who Benefits Most from Self-Hosted LLM Observability?
