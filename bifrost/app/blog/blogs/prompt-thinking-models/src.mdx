![How to Prompt Thinking Models like DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o1](/static/blog/prompt-thinking-models/cover.webp)

However, their reasoning ability also means you need to prompt them differently for the best results, and **most people get it wrong**.

Here's how to do it.

## Key Takeaways

Thinking models require a different approach compared to standard LLMs. Here‚Äôs a quick summary before diving into details:

{/* ### ‚úÖ DOs

- Use minimal prompting to let the model think independently.
- Encourage more reasoning for better performance at complex tasks by prompting for additional processing time.
  {/* - **Use structured prompts** when necessary for consistency. */}
- Use ensembling for highly complex tasks requiring high accuracy.

### ‚ùå DON‚ÄôTs

- Avoid <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/guides/prompt-engineering/implement-few-shot-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few-shot</a> and CoT prompting. Unlike traditional LLMs, thinking models perform worse when overloaded with examples or asked to "reason" step-by-step.
- Don‚Äôt use thinking models for structured outputs unless absolutely necessary. They perform worse with structured outputs than traditional models.
- Avoid overloading the model with unnecessary details. More context isn‚Äôt always better.

**Disclaimer:** The insights come from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research carried out by OpenAI and Microsoft</a> and our own personal experience.

Let's get into it!

## 1. Use Minimal Prompting

Thinking models work best when given **concise, direct, and structured** prompts.

Too much information can actually reduce accuracy. Unlike previous models where more context helped, thinking models already structure their reasoning internally.

The best approach is to state the problem clearly and let the model figure out the steps.

```
‚úÖ What are the main differences between classical and operant conditioning?

---

‚ùå In psychology, there are different learning theories. Classical conditioning was discovered by Pavlov, while operant conditioning was developed by Skinner. Could you please explain the difference between classical conditioning and operant conditioning? Make sure to include an example for each.
```

Fewer instructions allow the model to **engage its reasoning process naturally**.

## 2. Encourage More Reasoning for Complex Tasks

More complex problems benefit from additional reasoning time.

Thinking models use **reasoning tokens**, which allow them to internally process a problem before outputting an answer. By **prompting the model to take its time**, you can improve the quality of the response. However, this also increases token usage, impacting cost.

```
‚úÖ Analyze the economic impact of renewable energy adoption over the next 20 years. Consider factors such as job creation, energy prices, and carbon reduction. Take your time and think through each aspect carefully.

---

‚ùå How does renewable energy impact the economy? Answer quickly.
```

Encouraging longer reasoning helps with **multi-step problems**, improving accuracy significantly.

## 3. Avoid Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Traditional <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/guides/prompt-engineering/implement-few-shot-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few-shot</a> (where you give a bunch of examples) and <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/chain-of-thought-prompting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoT</a> prompting strategies **reduce performance** for thinking models.

According to the paper, openAI's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">o1-preview model performed worse</a> when given few-shot examples. This contrasts with older models, where few-shot learning improved results. Thinking models are already designed to break down problems internally, so explicit step-by-step guidance can interfere with their reasoning.

**Zero-shot prompts work better than few-shot prompts.**

## 4. Use Thinking Models for Complex Multi-Step Tasks

Thinking models perform best on tasks that require five or more steps.

When solving problems with 3-5 steps, thinking models offered a **slight improvement** over standard models. For simpler tasks (fewer than 3 steps), performance may actually **degrade** compared to traditional LLMs, because they "overthink."

If a task is highly structured or simple, a regular LLM like GPT-4 may be a better choice.

```
‚úÖ Break down the process of solving a complex physics problem involving momentum conservation. Explain each step clearly and logically.

---

‚ùå What is 2+2?
```

## 5. Use Delimiters to Structure Prompts for Consistent Outputs

For regular LLMs, developers typically use delimiters like triple quotation marks, XML tags, or section titles to clearly define distinct sections of the input. This makes it easier for the model to interpret the information correctly.

Thinking models struggle with structured outputs but can be guided to maintain consistency.

If you need a structured response (e.g., JSON, tables, fixed formats), structure your prompt carefully. However, if <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-structured-outputs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structured output</a> is critical, you‚Äôre better off using a standard LLM instead of a thinking model.

Thinking models are **not optimized for structured output** but can approximate it with carefully designed prompts.

## 6. Use Ensembling for Highly Complex Tasks

For high-stakes or complex problems, <a href="https://www.promptlayer.com/glossary/prompt-ensembling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensembling</a> improves performance.

Ensembling involves running multiple prompts (either the same prompt multiple times or variations of the prompt) and aggregating the results. This approach increases accuracy but **raises costs** because multiple queries are required.

```
‚úÖ #Prompt 1:
What are the primary causes of climate change? Provide a well-reasoned answer.

# Prompt 2:
Explain the major contributors to climate change, focusing on human activities and natural factors.

# Prompt 3:
Explain what causes climate change

<Context>
# [Response 1 + Response 2]
</Context>

---

‚ùå What causes climate change? Answer in a single response.
```

While ensembling boosts performance, it's expensive and should only be used when high accuracy is critical.

## 7. Use Chain-of-Draft Prompting to Minimize Token Usage

Thinking models can be token-hungry when reasoning through complex problems. <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/chain-of-draft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chain-of-Draft</a> prompting offers a solution by encouraging models to generate minimal yet informative reasoning steps.

```
‚úÖ [System Prompt]: Think step by step, but only keep a minimum draft for each thinking step, with 5 words at most.

What's the compound interest on $10,000 invested for 5 years at 8% annual interest rate?

---

‚ùå What's the compound interest on $10,000 invested for 5 years at 8% annual interest rate?
```

Unlike with traditional Chain-of-Thought, CoD prompts reasoning models to limit each reasoning step to just a few words (typically 5 or fewer), similar to how humans jot down concise notes rather than writing verbose explanations.

CoD can reduce token usage by up to a whopping **80%** while maintaining similar accuracy to the normal reasoning method.

## Summary

Prompting thinking models like DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o1 requires a different mindset and approach.

- Minimal, clear prompts work best, while forcing few-shot examples or step-by-step reasoning reduces effectiveness.
- When you must get a structured output, use standard LLMs instead.
- For even better responses, ensembling remains a powerful, though costly, technique.

With these guidelines, you can optimize your interactions with thinking models and get the best possible responses.
