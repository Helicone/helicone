In our <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/llm-observability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous article</a>, we explored the fundamentals of LLM observability and why it's crucial for building reliable AI applications. Now, let's dive into the **practical side**-how to actually implement effective monitoring for your LLM applications.

## 5 Best Practices for LLM Observability in Production

### 1. Use prompting techniques to reduce hallucinations

LLMs sometimes generate outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect - also known as hallucination. As your app usage goes up, hallucinations can happen frequently and undermine your user's trust.

The good news is, you can mitigate this by:

- Designing your prompts carefully with <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt engineering</a>, or
- Setting up evaluators to monitor your outputs in Helicone.

### 2. Prevent prompt injections

Malicious users can manipulate their inputs to trick your model into revealing sensitive information or take risky actions. We dive deeper into this topic in the <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"How to prevent prompt injections"</a> blog.

**On a high-level, you can prevent injections by**:

- Implementing strict validation of user inputs.
- Blocking inappropriate or malicious responses.
- Using tools like Helicone or PromptArmor for detection.

Helicone offers <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/llm-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in security</a> features powered by Meta's state-of-the-art security models to protect your LLM applications. You can enable LLM security with just a header:

```python
# Implementing LLM Security with Helicone
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}],
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-LLM-Security-Enabled": "true", # Enable basic security analysis
        "Helicone-LLM-Security-Advanced": "true" # Enable advanced security analysis
    }
)
```

### 3. Cache responses to reduce latency

Caching stores previously generated responses, allowing applications to quickly retrieve data without additional computation.

Latency can have the most impact on the user experience. Helicone allows you to cache responses on the edge, so that you can serve cached responses immediately without invoking the LLM API, reducing costs at the same time.

Simply add these headers if you want to <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up caching</a> in Helicone:

```python
openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

client.chat.completions.create(
  model="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Say this is a test",
  extra_headers={
    "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {HELICONE_API_KEY}",
    "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", # mandatory
    "Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3", # (optional) set cache bucket size to 3
    "Cache-Control": "max-age = 2592000", # (optional) change cache limit
    "Helicone-Cache-Seed": "1", # (optional) add cache seed
  }
)
```

### 4. Monitor and optimize costs

It's important to know exactly what might be drilling a hole in your operational cost. LLM monitoring can improve cost savings by tracking expenses for every model interaction, from the initial prompt to the final response.

**You can mitigate this by**:

- Monitoring LLM costs by project or user to understand spending.
- Optimizing infrastructure and usage.
- Fine-tuning smaller, open-source models to reduce costs.

### 5. Improve the prompt continuously

As models evolve, it's important to continuously test and audit your prompts to ensure they're performing as expected.

You should experiment with different variations of your prompt, switch models or set up different configurations to find the best performing prompt. You should also evaluate against key metrics that's important to your business.

![Helicone: Prompt Experiment & Evaluation](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/prompt-experiments.webp)

There are a few ways to do this in Helicone:

- Run a quick test on your new prompt changes in the <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/prompts/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prompt Editor</a>.
- Once you are ready to test the prompt at scale, run <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/experiments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt experiments</a> using production data.
- While in production, use <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sessions</a> to trace the workflows that are more prone to errors to help you pinpoint the exact request that's causing the issue.

## Bonus Tip: Real-Time Alerts

![Helicone: Real-Time Alerts](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/alerts.webp)

Setting up real-time alerts helps you get instant notifications on critical issues. Many LLM observability tools provide real-time alerts so that your team can respond quickly and improve the model's responsiveness.

In Helicone, you can configure <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/changelog/20240910-slack-alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack or email alerts</a> to send real-time updates by:

- **Defining threshold metrics**: Add critical metrics to a watchlist and set thresholds for triggering notification events.
- **Monitoring LLM drift**: Set up routine reports on key performance metrics to gain insight into model behavioral changes over time.
- **Detecting anomalies**: Train robust evaluators to identify unusual patterns of behavior.
- **Sending notifications**: Use webhooks to send alerts to dedicated communication channels
