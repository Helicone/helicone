![GPT-4o Mini vs GPT-4o Benchmarks](/static/blog/gpt-4o-mini-vs-claude-3.5-sonnet/gpt-comparison.webp)

In contrast, GPT-4o Mini achieved `53.6%` accuracy on zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) tasks which does not match the same level of performance in structured problem-solving scenarios. Its architecture is optimized for maintaining conversation flow and handling multimodal inputs but falls short in advanced reasoning tasks when compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

## Cost Considerations

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is priced at $3 per million input tokens, while GPT-4o Mini is more cost-effective at $0.15 per million input tokens. This pricing difference may influence users' choices depending on their budget constraints and usage volume.

## Accuracy and Handling Complex Tasks

Both models excel in accuracy and performance on complex tasks but in different ways. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is noted for its advanced reasoning capabilities, making it effective in structured problem-solving scenarios.

Conversely, GPT-4o Mini is recognized for maintaining conversation flow over extended interactions and handling dynamic tasks involving multimedia content.

Claude's ability to manage up to 200,000 tokens makes it particularly effective for structured problem-solving and detailed analysis. GPT-4o Mini remains robust for many applications but may face challenges in scenarios requiring extensive context retention over long exchanges.

## Context Window Comparison

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Maximum Context Window: 200,000 tokens

This extensive context window allows Claude to handle large amounts of information simultaneously, making it particularly effective for tasks that require maintaining coherence over long interactions, such as analyzing lengthy documents or managing complex conversations. It is well-suited for applications in fields like customer support and research, where deep contextual understanding is crucial.

### GPT-4o Mini

Maximum Context Window: 128,000 tokens

While smaller than Claude's, this context window is still substantial and allows GPT-4o Mini to process significant amounts of data. It is designed to excel in tasks that involve dynamic interactions and multimodal inputs (text, images, audio, and video). However, it may require segmenting very large datasets to fit within its constraints, which can limit its effectiveness in scenarios that demand extensive context retention.

### Implications of Context Window Differences

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is ideal for applications requiring long-form content processing and detailed history tracking due to its larger context window. With Claude's larger context window, it can maintain better coherence during extended dialogues or when processing large datasets without losing track of previous inputs.

GPT-4o Mini, while capable of handling substantial data, is more focused on efficiency and speed in contexts where the total amount of information does not exceed its limits. GPT-4o Mini’s smaller window may necessitate more careful management of input data to ensure that relevant context is preserved throughout interactions.
