Grok 3 just dropped and it's making big claims about being the "Smartest AI in the world". 

Built on massive computational resources and designed for real-time knowledge, it‚Äôs xAI‚Äôs strongest competitor yet.

With significant improvements over Grok 2, this model promises better coding skills, reasoning, and even **scientific problem-solving**. 

But how well does it actually perform? Let‚Äôs break it down.

## What‚Äôs New in Grok 3?

Grok 3 is a massive leap forward from its predecessor. Here‚Äôs what has changed:

- **10-15x Compute Power**: Compared to Grok 2, the new model operates with significantly more processing capacity.
- **100K+ Nvidia H100 GPUs**: Trained on xAI‚Äôs Memphis supercomputer, one of the largest AI clusters in the world‚Äîbuilt in 122 days.
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Runs multiple thought chains, self-corrects, and evaluates solutions before finalizing an answer.
- **Deep Search**: A "next generation search engine" that allows Grok 3 to not just search and retrieve real-time information across multiple sources, but think about what it finds and what to look for. Users can view its thought process in detail in real-time. Not to be confused with <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-deep-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**Deep Research**</a>
- **Big Brain mode**: A specialized mode where Grok 3 leverages additional compute resources to enhance its reasoning capabilities. This allows it to leverage more computing resources to perform complex multi-step problems.
- **Real-Time Knowledge**: Integrated with X, giving it access to up-to-the-minute information.
- **Better at Coding, Math, and Science**: Grok 3 excels in technical domains, making it a serious competitor in AI-driven research and programming tasks.

## So How Smart is Grok 3? Benchmarks and Real-World Performance 

### Benchmarks 

On paper, Grok 3 outperforms its rivals in various technical domains. Let‚Äôs look at some numbers:

#### Official Benchmarks: Grok 3 vs ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude

According to benchmark results shown in xAI's release demo, Grok 3 scores higher than **Gemini-2 Pro**, **DeepSeek V3**, **GPT-4o**, and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** in math (AIME), science (GPQA), and coding tasks (LiveCodeBench).

#### LMArena Benchmarks

Perhaps more notably, in blind user-voted evaluations on LMArena‚Äîa crowdsourced LLM benchmarking platform‚ÄîGrok 3 has set a **new milestone**. 

An early version of Grok 3 (codenamed ‚ÄúChocolate‚Äù) has officially taken the #1 spot, outperforming models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

**Breaking Records**

Impressively, Grok 3 simultaneously became the first-ever model to break the **1400 ELO** score barrier on LMArena‚Äîoutperforming all other models across **all** categories, including:

- Overall 
- Hard Prompts (Prompts that utilize a pre-designed template to elicit model outputs)
- Coding
- Math
- Creative Writing
- Instruction Following
- Longer Query Handling
- Multi-Turn Conversations

### Grok 3 in the Wild: Real-World Reviews

Early real-world tests show **mixed but promising** results. While Grok 3‚Äôs reasoning is top-tier, its performance in some areas still lags behind OpenAI‚Äôs best models.

#### Strengths

‚úÖ **Advanced Reasoning** 

Andrej Karpathy‚Äîwho got early access‚Äî<a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1891720635363254772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted on X</a> that Grok 3‚Äôs ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù mode solves complex problems better than many competitors. It successfully solved a tricky **Settlers of Catan** programming task that stumped most other models.

‚úÖ **Logic** 

The model performed well on structured logic problems, solving multiple tic-tac-toe challenges with proper chains of thought.

‚úÖ **Deep Search** 

Its **Deep Search** tool was praised for finding high-quality information on recent events, such as Apple launch rumors and stock surges, similar in depth and quality to Perplexity's Deep Research but not at the level of OpenAI's.

#### Weaknesses

‚ùå **Coding Performance**

An early user on X found Grok 3 <a href="https://x.com/theo/status/1891736803796832298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**struggled**</a> with somewhat complex coding, at least compared to GPT-4o and Claude which coded up better solutions as shown below.

‚ùå **Math & Symbolic Logic** 

While strong in structured problem-solving, it failed Andrej Karpathy‚Äôs **Unicode emoji mystery challenge**, whereas DeepSeek's R1 performed better.

The most progress I've seen is from DeepSeek-R1 which once partially decoded the message."

‚ùå **Humor & Creativity** 

The model lacks any advanced abilities for humor. When asked for jokes, it repeatedly gave variations of the same puns, similar to older LLMs. Given that

‚ùå **Fact-checking Issues** 

Grok 3 was caught **hallucinating citations** and even inventing fake URLs, similar to problems seen in other LLMs.

Overall, Grok 3 so far has been impressive but not perfect‚Äîand seemingly not the "Smartest AI in the world" as Musk claims as it still lags behind other LLMs in some areas.

## What‚Äôs Next for xAI and Grok?

xAI has big plans beyond Grok 3. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming next:

- **API Access**: Developers will soon be able to integrate Grok into their own applications.
- **Super Grok Subscription**: A premium tier offering early access to cutting-edge features.
- **Voice Mode**: A fully interactive AI voice assistant, expected within a week.
- **Memory Features**: Persistent memory to recall past conversations for personalized interactions.
- **Bigger AI Cluster**: xAI is already working on a 5x more powerful training setup.
- **Scientific Breakthroughs?**: Elon Musk predicts AI will win (or at least help to) a Nobel, Turing, or Fields Medal within the next 1-2 years.

## Final Thoughts: Is Grok 3 the undisputed King?

Grok 3 is xAI‚Äôs most serious attempt at competing with OpenAI, Google, and others. It‚Äôs a leap forward in AI capability, with superior reasoning and a massive compute infrastructure behind it.

However, despite the improvements, Grok 3 is not yet the undisputed best. It still lags behind OpenAI‚Äôs best models in benchmarks, and its real-world performance is mixed.

Here's what the benchmark from earlier looks like with OpenAI o3 added:

That said, xAI‚Äôs rapid progress with Grok has been nothing short of remarkable and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming months.
