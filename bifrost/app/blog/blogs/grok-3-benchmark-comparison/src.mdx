### LMArena Benchmarks

Perhaps more notably, in blind user-voted evaluations on LMArena‚Äîa crowd-sourced LLM benchmarking platform‚ÄîGrok 3 has <a href="https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1891706264800936307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a new milestone</a>.

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that rely on static test sets, LMArena uses live human feedback in a blind A/B test format, making it one of the most reliable indicators of real-world AI performance."

An early version of Grok 3 (codenamed "Chocolate") has officially taken the #1 spot, outperforming models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

### Grok 3 Breaks Records

Impressively, Grok 3 simultaneously became the first-ever model to break the **1400 ELO** score barrier on LMArena‚Äîoutperforming all other models across **all** categories, including overall, Hard Prompts (Prompts that utilize a pre-designed template to elicit model outputs), Coding, Math, Creative Writing, Instruction Following, Longer Query Handling, and Multi-Turn Conversations.

## Grok 3 in the Wild: Real-World Reviews

Early real-world tests show **mixed but promising** results. While Grok 3's reasoning is top-tier, its performance in some areas still lags behind OpenAI's best models.

### Strengths

‚úîÔ∏è **Advanced Reasoning**

Andrej Karpathy‚Äîwho got early access‚Äî<a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1891720635363254772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted on X</a> that Grok 3's "Thinking" mode solves complex problems better than many competitors. It successfully solved a tricky **Settlers of Catan** programming task that stumped most other models.

‚úîÔ∏è **Logic**

The model performed well on structured logic problems, solving multiple tic-tac-toe challenges with proper chains of thought.

‚úîÔ∏è **Deep Search**

Its **Deep Search** tool was praised for finding high-quality information on recent events, such as Apple launch rumors and stock surges, similar in depth and quality to Perplexity's Deep Research but not at the level of OpenAI's.

### Weaknesses

üÜá **Coding Performance**

An early user on X found Grok 3 <a href="https://x.com/theo/status/1891736803796832298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**struggled with somewhat complex coding**</a>, at least compared to GPT-4o and Claude which coded up better solutions as shown below.

üÜá **Math & Symbolic Logic**

While strong in structured problem-solving, it failed Andrej Karpathy's <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1891720635363254772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unicode emoji mystery challenge</a>, whereas DeepSeek's R1 performed better.

In his tweet, Karpathy said "[Grok 3] did not solve my question where I give a smiling face with an attached message hidden inside Unicode variation selectors, even when I give a strong hint on how to decode it in the form of Rust code. The most progress I've seen is from DeepSeek-R1 which once partially decoded the message."

üÜá **Humor & Creativity**

The model lacks any advanced abilities for humor. When asked for jokes, it repeatedly gave variations of the same puns, similar to older LLMs, as Andrej Karpathy shared in his tweet.

üÜá **Fact-checking Issues**

In the same tweet, Andrej also found Grok 3 **hallucinating citations** and even inventing fake URLs, similar to problems seen in other LLMs.

### Final Thoughts

Overall, Grok 3 has been impressive so far but not perfect‚Äîand seemingly not the "Smartest AI in the world" as Musk claims as it still lags behind other LLMs in some areas.

Grok 3 still lags behind OpenAI's best models in benchmarks, and its real-world performance is mixed. Just take a look at the benchmark from earlier <a href="https://x.com/12exyz/status/1891723056931827959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with OpenAI o3 added</a>:

## Grok Studio: The New Canvas-Style Creation Tool

On April 15, 2025, xAI introduced Grok Studio, a new feature that allows users to:

- Edit and create documents
- Write and execute code (supporting Python, C++, JavaScript)
- Build basic applications
- Integrate with Google Drive

This feature puts Grok in direct competition with similar offerings from other AI companies:
- OpenAI's Canvas for ChatGPT (introduced October 2024)
- Anthropic's Artifacts for Claude

Grok Studio is available to both free and paid users.

## What's Next for xAI and Grok?

xAI continues to expand its offerings. Here's what's coming next:

- **Super Grok Subscription**: A premium tier offering early access to cutting-edge features.
- **Voice Mode**: A fully interactive AI voice assistant, expected soon.
- **Memory Features**: Persistent memory to recall past conversations for personalized interactions.
- **Bigger AI Cluster**: xAI is already working on a 5x more powerful training setup.
- **Scientific Breakthroughs?**: Elon Musk predicts AI will win (or at least help to) a Nobel, Turing, or Fields Medal within the next 1-2 years.

## Final Thoughts: Is Grok 3 the Undisputed King?

Grok 3 is xAI's most serious attempt at competing with OpenAI, Google, and others. It's a leap forward in AI capability, with superior reasoning and a massive compute infrastructure behind it.

However, despite the improvements, Grok 3 is not yet the undisputed best as it still lags behind OpenAI's o3 model in benchmarks.

With the recent release of its API and Grok Studio, xAI is clearly positioning itself as a full-spectrum AI provider, moving beyond just a chatbot to offer developer tools and creative workspaces. This puts it in direct competition with established players like OpenAI and Anthropic, who have already made similar moves.

That said, xAI's rapid progress with Grok has been nothing short of remarkable and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming months.
