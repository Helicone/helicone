## What‚Äôs New in Grok 3?

Grok 3 is a massive leap forward from its predecessor. Here‚Äôs what changed:

- **10-15x Compute power** compared to Grok 2.
- **100K+ Nvidia H100 GPUs**: Trained on xAI‚Äôs Memphis supercomputer, one of the largest AI clusters in the world‚Äîbuilt in 122 days.
- **Advanced reasoning**: Runs multiple thought chains, self-corrects, and evaluates solutions before finalizing an answer.
- **Deep Search**: A "next generation search engine" that allows Grok 3 to think about what it finds across sources and what to look for, not just search and retrieve information. Users can see its thought process in detail in real-time. Not to be confused with <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-deep-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Research</a>.
- **Big Brain mode**: A specialized mode where Grok 3 uses additional compute resources to improve its reasoning capabilities, and perform complex multi-step problems.
- **Real-time knowledge**: Integrated with X, access to up-to-the-minute information.
- **Better at coding, math, and science**: Grok 3 excels in technical domains, making it a serious competitor in AI-driven research and programming tasks.

## So How Smart is Grok 3? Here's the Benchmarks and Real-World Performance

### Benchmarks: Grok 3 vs ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude

On paper, Grok 3 outperforms its rivals in various technical domains. Let‚Äôs look at some numbers.

According to benchmark results shown in xAI's release demo, Grok 3 scores **higher than Gemini-2 Pro, <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/deepseek-v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepSeek V3</a>, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet** in math (AIME), science (GPQA), and coding tasks (LiveCodeBench).

### LMArena Benchmarks

Perhaps more notably, in blind user-voted evaluations on LMArena‚Äîa crowd-sourced LLM benchmarking platform‚ÄîGrok 3 has <a href="https://x.com/lmarena_ai/status/1891706264800936307" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set a new milestone</a>.

Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that rely on static test sets, LMArena uses live human feedback in a blind A/B test format, making it one of the most reliable indicators of real-world AI performance."

An early version of Grok 3 (codenamed ‚ÄúChocolate‚Äù) has officially taken the #1 spot, outperforming models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

### Grok 3 Breaks Records

Impressively, Grok 3 simultaneously became the first-ever model to break the **1400 ELO** score barrier on LMArena‚Äîoutperforming all other models across **all** categories, including overall, Hard Prompts (Prompts that utilize a pre-designed template to elicit model outputs), Coding, Math, Creative Writing, Instruction Following, Longer Query Handling, and Multi-Turn Conversations.

## Grok 3 in the Wild: Real-World Reviews

Early real-world tests show **mixed but promising** results. While Grok 3‚Äôs reasoning is top-tier, its performance in some areas still lags behind OpenAI‚Äôs best models.

### Strengths

‚úîÔ∏è **Advanced Reasoning**

Andrej Karpathy‚Äîwho got early access‚Äî<a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1891720635363254772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted on X</a> that Grok 3‚Äôs ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù mode solves complex problems better than many competitors. It successfully solved a tricky **Settlers of Catan** programming task that stumped most other models.

‚úîÔ∏è **Logic**

The model performed well on structured logic problems, solving multiple tic-tac-toe challenges with proper chains of thought.

‚úîÔ∏è **Deep Search**

Its **Deep Search** tool was praised for finding high-quality information on recent events, such as Apple launch rumors and stock surges, similar in depth and quality to Perplexity's Deep Research but not at the level of OpenAI's.

### Weaknesses

üÜá **Coding Performance**

An early user on X found Grok 3 <a href="https://x.com/theo/status/1891736803796832298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**struggled with somewhat complex coding**</a>, at least compared to GPT-4o and Claude which coded up better solutions as shown below.

üÜá **Math & Symbolic Logic**

While strong in structured problem-solving, it failed Andrej Karpathy‚Äôs <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1891720635363254772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unicode emoji mystery challenge</a>, whereas DeepSeek's R1 performed better.

In his tweet, Karpathy said "[Grok 3] did not solve my question where I give a smiling face with an attached message hidden inside Unicode variation selectors, even when I give a strong hint on how to decode it in the form of Rust code. The most progress I've seen is from DeepSeek-R1 which once partially decoded the message."

üÜá **Humor & Creativity**

The model lacks any advanced abilities for humor. When asked for jokes, it repeatedly gave variations of the same puns, similar to older LLMs, as Andrej Karpathy shared in his tweet.

üÜá **Fact-checking Issues**

In the same tweet, Andrej also found Grok 3 **hallucinating citations** and even inventing fake URLs, similar to problems seen in other LLMs.

### Final Thoughts

Overall, Grok 3 has been impressive so far but not perfect‚Äîand seemingly not the "Smartest AI in the world" as Musk claims as it still lags behind other LLMs in some areas.

Grok 3 still lags behind OpenAI‚Äôs best models in benchmarks, and its real-world performance is mixed. Just take a look at the benchmark from earlier <a href="https://x.com/12exyz/status/1891723056931827959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with OpenAI o3 added</a>:

## Final Thoughts: Is Grok 3 the Undisputed King?

Grok 3 is xAI‚Äôs most serious attempt at competing with OpenAI, Google, and others. It‚Äôs a leap forward in AI capability, with superior reasoning and a massive compute infrastructure behind it.

However, despite the improvements, Grok 3 is not yet the undisputed best as it still lags behind OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model in benchmarks.

That said, xAI‚Äôs rapid progress with Grok has been nothing short of remarkable and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming months.
