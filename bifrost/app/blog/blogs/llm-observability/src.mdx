![Helicone: What is LLM Observability and Monitoring](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/llm-observability-cover.webp)

In this guide, we'll explore the specialized discipline of LLM observability and share battle-tested techniques for maintaining reliable AI applications at scale.

Let's dive in!

## What is LLM Observability?

LLM Observability refers to the comprehensive monitoring, tracing, and analysis of LLM-powered applications. It involves gaining deep insights into every aspect of the system, from <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt engineering</a>, to monitoring model responses and user interactions, to evaluating the LLM outputs.

As your product transitions from prototype to production, monitoring key performance metrics helps you to continuously detect anomalies, such as <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/how-to-reduce-llm-hallucination" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hallucinations</a> and ethical breaches, and <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/when-to-finetune#when-fine-tuning-makes-sense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fine-tune</a> your model for better performance on the go.

## Why do we need LLM Observability?

- **Understand model behavior**: Gain visibility into how the model processes inputs and generates outputs.
- **Diagnose issues**: Quickly identify and resolve errors, bottlenecks, and anomalies.
- **Optimize performance**: Enhance latency and throughput by fine-tuning model parameters and infrastructure.
- **Improve user experience**: Tailor responses to meet user expectations and improve satisfaction.
- **Ensure compliance**: Maintain data privacy and adhere to regulatory requirements.

## LLM Observability vs. Traditional Observability

LLM observability deals with highly complex models that contain billions of parameters, making it challenging to understand how prompt changes affect the model's behavior.

While traditional observability focuses on system logs and performance metrics, LLM observability deals with model inputs/outputs, prompts, and embeddings.

Another difference is the non-deterministic nature of LLMs. Traditional systems are often deterministic with **expected behaviors**, whereas LLMs frequently produce **variable outputs**, making evaluation more nuanced.

**In summary:**

## The Pillars of LLM Observability

![Helicone: The Pillars of LLM Observability](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/overview.webp)

### 1. Traces & Spans

At the core of LLM observability is the detailed logging and tracing of workflows through your application. This includes tracking both requests and responses, as well as the multi-step interactions that often characterize LLM applications.

Comprehensive traces capture the journey of a user interaction from initial prompt to final response, helping you understand complex conversations and context over time. This is especially valuable for <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/how-to-debug-llm-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debugging</a> and <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/replaying-llm-sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">optimizing</a> multi-step workflows.

![Helicone: Traces and Spans](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/traces-and-spans.webp)

**What's involved in tracing and logging?**

- **Request and Response Logging**: Capturing raw requests to LLM services and their corresponding responses, along with metadata like latency, token counts, costs or <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties#custom-properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom ones</a>.
- **Multi-Step Workflow Tracing**: Using tools like Helicone's <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sessions</a> to track user journeys across multiple interactions, making it easier to debug complex agent-based systems.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying patterns of unusual behavior, potential failures, or hallucinations by analyzing traces across multiple user sessions.

Here's a screenshot of the dashboard that shows aggregated metrics for traces: 

![Helicone: Anomaly Detection](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/anomaly-detection.webp)

Monitoring tools typically capture other useful metrics like latency, costs, Time to First Token (TTFT), and more. All these traces create a comprehensive view of your application's behavior over time. 

### 2. LLM Evaluation

Assessing the quality of your model's outputs is vital for continuous improvement. This pillar focuses on measuring how well your LLM performs against specific criteria and expectations.

![Helicone: LLM Evaluation](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/llm-evaluation.webp)

**Effective evaluation includes:**

- **Online and Offline Evaluation**: Testing model outputs both in real-time (online) and through batch processing of historical data (offline).
- **Metrics Definition**: Establishing clear metrics for relevance, coherence, correctness, and other quality indicators.
- <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Feedback</a>: Gathering direct input from users to understand their experience with model responses.
- **Automated Evaluation**: Using LLM-as-judge or other programmatic methods to consistently assess outputs when human evaluation isn't practical.
- **Regression Prevention**: Identifying when changes to prompts or models result in decreased performance.

Through robust evaluation practices, you can continuously improve accuracy and reduce unwanted behaviors like hallucinations.

### 3. Prompt Engineering

Crafting effective prompts is both an art and a science. This pillar focuses on systematically testing, refining, and managing the inputs you provide to LLMs.

![Helicone: Prompt Engineering](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/prompt-engineering.webp)

**Important aspects include:**

- **Prompt Versioning**: Keeping track of prompt changes and their impact on model outputs.
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing different prompt strategies to identify which produces better results.
- **Prompt Templates**: Standardizing successful prompt patterns for consistent performance.
- **Hallucination Reduction**: Refining prompts to minimize incorrect or fabricated information.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Iteratively optimizing prompts based on evaluation results.

<a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools#key-prompting-techniques--best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good prompt engineering practices</a> lead to more reliable outputs, better user experiences, and often reduced costs through more efficient token usage.

### 4. Search and Retrieval

For knowledge-intensive applications, the quality of information provided to the LLM is crucial. This pillar focuses on optimizing how relevant content is retrieved and incorporated into the generation process.

**Key components include:**

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhancing LLM outputs with relevant external information.
- **Tool Calls**: Integrating specialized functions that LLMs can leverage to perform specific tasks.
- **Vector Database Management**: Optimizing how information is stored and retrieved for use in prompts.
- **Retrieval Quality Metrics**: Measuring how well your system fetches relevant information to support LLM responses.

Effective search and retrieval mechanisms help ground LLM responses in accurate information, reducing hallucinations and improving factuality.

### 5. LLM Security

Ensuring the safety and integrity of your LLM application is non-negotiable. This pillar addresses potential vulnerabilities and abuse scenarios unique to language models.

#### LLM-specific protections

Robust security measures protect both your application and its users, building trust and preventing potential misuse. Implementing safeguards against <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection#what-is-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt injections</a> and other <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/llm-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLM-specific cybersecurity attacks</a> is crucial.


#### Custom Rate Limiting

To further protect your application from abuse or unexpected costs, Helicone provides <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-rate-limits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom rate limiting</a> capabilities. You can control LLM usage by setting limits based on request count, cost, or custom properties.

Simply add the following header to your requests:

```
"Helicone-RateLimit-Policy": "100;w=3600;u=request;s=user"
```

This would limit each user to 100 requests per hour. You can also limit by cost using cents as the unit, helping you maintain predictable spending even as your application scales.

## 5 Best Practices for Monitoring Production LLM Apps

### 1. Use prompting techniques to reduce hallucinations

LLMs sometimes generate outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect - also known as hallucination. As your app usage goes up, hallucinations can happen frequently and undermine your user's trust.

The good news is, you can mitigate this by:

- Designing your prompts carefully with <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompt engineering</a>, or
- Setting up evaluators to monitor your outputs in Helicone.

### 2. Prevent prompt injections

Malicious users can manipulate their inputs to trick your model into revealing sensitive information or take risky actions. We dive deeper into this topic in the <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/preventing-prompt-injection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"How to prevent prompt injections"</a> blog.

**On a high-level, you can prevent injections by**:

- Implementing strict validation of user inputs.
- Blocking inappropriate or malicious responses.
- Using tools like Helicone or PromptArmor for detection.

Helicone offers <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/llm-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in security</a> features powered by Meta's state-of-the-art security models to protect your LLM applications. You can enable LLM security with just a header:

```python
# Implementing LLM Security with Helicone
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}],
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-LLM-Security-Enabled": "true", # Enable basic security analysis
        "Helicone-LLM-Security-Advanced": "true" # Enable advanced security analysis
    }
)
```

### 3. Cache responses to reduce latency

Caching stores previously generated responses, allowing applications to quickly retrieve data without additional computation.

Latency can have the most impact on the user experience. Helicone allows you to cache responses on the edge, so that you can serve cached responses immediately without invoking the LLM API, reducing costs at the same time.

Simply add these headers if you want to <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up caching</a> in Helicone:

```python
openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

client.chat.completions.create(
  model="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Say this is a test",
  extra_headers={
    "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {HELICONE_API_KEY}",
    "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", # mandatory
    "Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3", # (optional) set cache bucket size to 3
    "Cache-Control": "max-age = 2592000", # (optional) change cache limit
    "Helicone-Cache-Seed": "1", # (optional) add cache seed
  }
)
```

### 4. Monitor and optimize costs

It's important to know exactly what might be drilling a hole in your operational cost. LLM monitoring can improve cost savings by tracking expenses for every model interaction, from the initial prompt to the final response.

**You can mitigate this by**:

- Monitoring LLM costs by project or user to understand spending.
- Optimizing infrastructure and usage.
- Fine-tuning smaller, open-source models to reduce costs.

For more effective cost optimization strategies, check out our blog on <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/blog/monitor-and-optimize-llm-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to cut LLM costs by 90%</a>.

### 5. Improve the prompt continuously

As models evolve, it's important to continuously test and audit your prompts to ensure they're performing as expected.

You should experiment with different variations of your prompt, switch models or set up different configurations to find the best performing prompt. You should also evaluate against key metrics that's important to your business.

![Helicone: Prompt Experiment & Evaluation](/static/blog/best-practices-for-llm-observability/prompt-experiments.webp)

There are a few ways to do this in Helicone:

- Run a quick test on your new prompt changes in the <a href="https://docs.helicone.ai/features/prompts/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prompt Editor</a>.
