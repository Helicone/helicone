## Introduction

Meta’s release of Segment Anything Model for videos and images (SAM 2) represents a significant leap in AI capabilities, introducing a unified model for real-time, promptable object segmentation in both images and videos. This advancement is poised to revolutionize how developers approach multi-modal AI systems, integrating visual and textual data more seamlessly than ever before.


## Overview 

The original Meta Segment Anything Model (SAM) laid the groundwork for versatile object segmentation in static images. SAM 2 builds on this by extending its capabilities to video content, allowing for real-time segmentation and tracking across both images and videos with impressive accuracy. This unified model simplifies the previously complex task of video segmentation, offering a more cohesive solution for handling diverse visual data.

## Practical Applications

**Multimodal AI**

SAM 2 can be combined with text-based LLMs to create more robust multi-modal applications. Helicone, currently **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>the only observability tool supporting both text and image-based LLMs</span>**, is inspired by SAM 2’s capabilities and is moving towards enhanced multi-modal support, including integration with models like GPT-4 Vision and Claude 3.


**Annotation and data preparation**

SAM 2 accelerates the process of data labeling by providing precise and efficient object segmentation, reducing the time and effort required for annotation. This capability is especially valuable for training AI models that rely on large, accurately labeled datasets.

**User interfaces and AR/VR**

By integrating SAM 2’s segmentation features, developers can enhance user interfaces and create **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>more immersive augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences</span>**. The ability to segment objects in real-time opens up new possibilities for interactive and contextually aware applications in these spaces.

**Creative and scientific uses**

SAM 2’s advanced segmentation can be applied to creative projects, such as **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>generating video effects</span>** or enhancing visual content creation, as well as scientific research, including **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>tracking and analyzing moving objects</span>** in complex datasets. This versatility supports a wide range of innovative applications across industries.
