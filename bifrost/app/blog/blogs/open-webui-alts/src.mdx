--cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
-v ${STORAGE_LOCATION}:/app/server/storage \
-v ${STORAGE_LOCATION}/.env:/app/server/.env \
-e STORAGE_DIR="/app/server/storage" \
mintplexlabs/anythingllm
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:STORAGE_LOCATION="$HOME\Documents\anythingllm"; `
If(!(Test-Path $env:STORAGE_LOCATION)) {New-Item $env:STORAGE_LOCATION -ItemType Directory}; `
If(!(Test-Path "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION\.env")) {New-Item "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION\.env" -ItemType File}; `
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 `
--cap-add SYS_ADMIN `
-v "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION`:/app/server/storage" `
-v "$env:STORAGE_LOCATION\.env:/app/server/.env" `
-e STORAGE_DIR="/app/server/storage" `
mintplexlabs/anythingllm;
