## The Observability Platform Designed for Modern LLMs

Weights and Biases (WandB) is an established machine learning platform offering a wide array of features for training models, such as high-level experiment tracking and visualization. 

However, training modern LLMs is generally less complex than traditional ML models, so its extensive features can often make the platform feel overloaded and add unnecessary confusion.   

**Helicone offers something better:** all the essential tools specifically designed for language model observability — **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>without the clutter</span>**.


## Compare

**Helicone is more cost-effective, user-friendly, and easy to integrate.** It empowers both your technical and non-technical teams to efficiently track and manage production metrics such as *latency, costs,* and *time to first tokens*. 


Weights and Biases' primary focus is to offer an infrastructure for managing and scaling machine learning workflows. WandB concentrates on managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation and model development to deployment and monitoring.


### Cost and Pricing Model

- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone:</span>** Offers *unlimited seats* and charges based on *usage*, making it a more cost-effective solution ideal for startups, growing teams, and organizations with fluctuating usage patterns.
- **WandB:** Charges per seat, which can quickly add up for larger teams.

### Ease of Integration

- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone:</span>** Simplifies integration, allowing for smoother adoption into existing workflows.
- **WandB:** More difficult to integrate into your tech stack as it doesn't offer a proxy and requires installing their package.

### User-friendliness

- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone:</span>** Provides an intuitive dashboard that even non-technical users can easily derive value from.
- **WandB:** Requires using Jupyter notebooks to build dashboards, which can be less user-friendly for non-technical people.

### Functionality & Features

- **<span style={{color: '#0ea5e9'}}>Helicone:</span>** Excels in tracking production metrics such as cost and provides prompt tracking, making it particularly suited for monitoring modern LLMs.
- **WandB:** Focuses more on classic ML tasks and offers better integrations for running evaluations, model versioning and giving users more control over their experiments.



## **Why Helicone Wins**

### The Developer Experience

The developer experience with Helicone is excellent for both beginners and experienced users. Those unfamiliar with machine learning and model development workflows may find WandB to be overwhelming.

### Resources

Weights and Biases provides detailed logging and tracing, which can be resource-intensive and is a consideration for projects with limited computational resources.

### Cost-effectiveness

Helicone operates on a volumetric pricing model, making it a more cost-effective option if you have high-volume usage. In addition, the first 100,000 requests per month are free. 

### Reliability and Scalability

Both Helicone and WandB are **open-source** and can **handle massive scale**. With Helicone, we integrated Kafka into our core data pipeline to ensure 100% log coverage, and use Cloudflare Workers to ensure sub-millisecond latency impact.




## Helicone vs. Weights and Biases, which is worth the money?

**Helicone is ideal if you want a simple way to track and manage production metrics for your LLM.** With the lightweight design, seamless integration with your preferred model provider, and cost-effective pricing, it's the perfect choice for developers working with LLMs.

Weights and Biases is ideal for developers who need deep insights into model performance, detailed experiment tracking, and fine-tuning capabilities.
