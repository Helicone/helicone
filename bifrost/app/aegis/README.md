# AEGIS April Fools Page

This directory contains an April Fools joke page for Helicone that parodies the concept of AGI risk monitoring through API traffic.

## Overview

The page presents "AEGIS: AGI Early Governance & Intervention System" as a fictional service that claims to detect AGI emergence through API traffic patterns monitored by Helicone.

## Key Features

- Mock intelligence agency partners
- Fake AGI threat level dashboard
- Emergency alert signup (just sends a confirmation message)
- Mobile notification mockup
- Testimonials from "anonymous intelligence officials"

## Notes

This is intended as a lighthearted joke for April 1st and clearly identifies itself as such at the bottom of the page. The page uses dramatic red warning graphics and meaningless but impressive-looking charts to create a parody of AGI risk monitoring.
