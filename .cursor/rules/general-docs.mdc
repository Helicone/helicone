# AI Gateway Documentation Standards

This rule defines the standard structure, style, and conventions for all AI Gateway concept and feature documentation.

## Document Structure Pattern

Every AI Gateway documentation file must follow this exact structure:

### 1. Front Matter (Required)

```yaml
---
title: "[Full Descriptive Title]"
sidebarTitle: "[Short Navigation Title]"
description: "[Detailed description with value proposition and key benefits. Should be 1-2 sentences explaining what the feature does and why it's valuable.]"
---
```

### 2. Content Flow Structure (Required Order)

1. **Introduction Content** (Required - NO HEADER)

```mdx
[Concise feature overview paragraph - 1-2 sentences maximum explaining what it does]

[Optional secondary paragraph with brief technical context - 1 sentence maximum]

**Benefits:**
- **[Primary Benefit]** by [specific capability or outcome]
- **[Secondary Benefit]** with [technical advantage]
- **[Tertiary Benefit]** by [user experience improvement]
```

**Guidelines for Introduction:**
- Feature overview: Maximum 2 sentences
- Optional second paragraph: Maximum 1 sentence
- Benefits: Exactly 3 benefits maximum
- Keep total introduction under 100 words

2. **Optional Info/Warning Callouts** (As needed)

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Documentation Types and Approach

AI Gateway documentation combines **explanation** (understanding-oriented) and **reference** (information-oriented) approaches:

**Explanation sections** (Introduction, Use Cases, How It Works):
- **Understanding-oriented**: Help readers comprehend concepts and make connections
- **Discursive treatment**: Allow for reflection and deeper understanding
- **Context-rich**: Provide background, design decisions, and the "why" behind features
- **Opinion-inclusive**: Acknowledge alternatives, trade-offs, and different perspectives

**Reference sections** (Quick Start, Configuration Options):
- **Information-oriented**: Provide factual, authoritative technical descriptions
- **Austere and precise**: Neutral description without opinion or speculation
- **Action-focused**: Clear, imperative instructions for immediate use
- **Consistent patterns**: Standardized formatting for predictable user experience

### Tone & Voice

- **Explanatory sections**: Conversational yet authoritative, helping readers understand the "why" and broader context
- **Reference sections**: Neutral, factual, and uncompromising - like consulting a technical manual
- **Throughout**: Confident presentation of information as definitive and reliable
- **Accessible**: Complex concepts explained simply without sacrificing technical accuracy

### Content Patterns

1. **Open with understanding** - Explain what it does, why it matters, and how it fits into the bigger picture
2. **Provide immediate utility** - Quick Start with minimal, working configuration
3. **Describe the machinery** - Neutral, complete description of available options and their behavior
4. **Contextualize with scenarios** - Real-world use cases that help readers understand when and how to apply features
5. **Unfold the internal workings** - Technical implementation details that reveal how the system operates

### Language Conventions

**For explanation sections:**
- Use present tense for descriptions
- Make connections to related concepts and external context
- Provide historical context and design rationale where relevant
- Acknowledge alternatives: "Some users prefer X because Y, however Z..."
- Explain relationships: "Feature X interacts with Y as follows..."

**For reference sections:**
- Use imperative mood for instructions ("Create", "Start", "Configure")
- State facts about behavior: "The gateway routes requests based on..."
- List options systematically: "Available strategies are: A, B, C"
- Provide warnings where appropriate: "You must not use X unless Y"
- Use consistent, predictable patterns for similar information

**Throughout:**
- Use "The AI Gateway" when referring to the system
- Be specific with technical terms and provide context
- Use bullet points with bold lead-ins for benefits and key concepts
- Maintain consistent placeholder naming conventions

## Technical Implementation Standards

### Configuration Examples

Always use YAML configuration blocks with proper syntax:

```yaml
# Use comments to explain complex sections
routers:
  my-router:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - openai
          - anthropic
```

### Code Examples

Use appropriate language-specific examples:

```bash
# Bash commands for setup and testing
export API_KEY="your-key"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/chat/completions
```

```python
# Python SDK configuration
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/router/production",
    api_key="sk-placeholder"
)
```

### Placeholder Conventions

- `sk-...` for API keys in examples
- `my-router` for router names in examples
- `localhost:8080` for gateway URLs
- `[router-name]` for variable router names in documentation

## UI Components Standards

### Required Components Usage

**Steps Component** (for sequential processes):

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="Action-oriented title">
    Clear instructions with code examples
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

**Accordion Components** (for feature options):

```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Feature Name - Default" icon="lucide-icon">
    Technical explanation with examples
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```

**Tabs Component** (for use cases):

```mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Case Name">
    Complete scenario with configuration
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

**Callout Components**:

- `<Note>` - General information and cross-references
- `<Info>` - Important context or clarifications
- `<Callout type="warning">` - Constraints or important warnings

## Content Organization Standards

### Header Hierarchy

- `# Title` - Only in front matter, never in content
- `## Major Sections` - Quick Start, Available Options, Use Cases, How It Works
- `### Subsections` - Request Flow, specific configuration areas
- `#### Sub-subsections` - Rare, only for complex nested content

### Section Naming Conventions

- **NO `## Introduction` header** - start directly with content
- `## Quick Start` (required)
- `## Available [Strategies/Options/Features]` (required)
- `## Use Cases` (required)
- `## How It Works` (required)
- `### Request Flow` (common subsection)

### Icon Usage

Use appropriate Lucide icons for accordions:
- `bolt` - Performance/speed related features
- `key` - Authentication/security features
- `bucket` - Storage/caching features
- `chart-pie` - Analytics/distribution features
- `gear` - Configuration/settings features
