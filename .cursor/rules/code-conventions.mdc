# Code Conventions and Best Practices

This document outlines the code conventions and best practices used in the LLM Proxy codebase.

## Rust Conventions

- Use the 2024 edition of Rust as specified in [Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml)
- Follow the formatting rules in [rustfmt.toml](mdc:rustfmt.toml)
- Use clippy lints defined in the workspace configuration:
  - All clippy lints are set to "deny"
  - Pedantic lints are set to "warn"

## Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for defining error types
- Use `anyhow` for internal error propagation
- Structured errors in [llm-proxy/src/error/](mdc:llm-proxy/src/error/)

## Type Definitions

- Leverage Rust's type system for safety
- Provider-specific types in separate crates:
  - [crates/openai-types/](mdc:crates/openai-types/)
  - [crates/anthropic-types/](mdc:crates/anthropic-types/)
- Common types in [llm-proxy/src/types/](mdc:llm-proxy/src/types/)

## Testing Approaches

- Unit tests alongside the code they test
- Integration tests in separate directories
- Use the `serial_test` crate for tests that can't run in parallel
- Leverage the test utilities in [llm-proxy/src/tests/](mdc:llm-proxy/src/tests/)

## Dependency Management

- Common dependencies are defined at the workspace level
- Version pinning for all dependencies
- Minimal dependency usage with feature flags when appropriate
