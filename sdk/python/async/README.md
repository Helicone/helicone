)

logger.init()

client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Make the OpenAI call
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
