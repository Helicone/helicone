### How Helicone works

Helicone is a proxy server for executing OpenAI completions queries on your
behalf, logging useful stats about your request such as the latency, result, and
cost to a database.

Our workers are secured by Cloudflare to ensure you are getting the best latency
on your requests, wherever you are in the world.
