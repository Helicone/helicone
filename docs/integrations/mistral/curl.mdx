# Mistral cURL Integration

This guide explains how to integrate Mistral AI with Helicone for logging and monitoring Mistral API usage using cURL.

## Account Setup

1. Create a Helicone account or log in at [helicone.ai](https://helicone.ai)
2. Generate a Helicone API key from the [developer portal](https://helicone.ai/keys)

## API Configuration

1. Use Helicone's proxy URL (`https://mistral.helicone.ai/v1`)
