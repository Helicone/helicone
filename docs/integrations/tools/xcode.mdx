This guide shows how to add Helicone as a model provider in Xcode so your chats route through the Helicone AI Gateway and show up in your Helicone dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- A Helicone account and API key
- Org/provider keys configured in Helicone (so models can be listed)

## Steps

1) Open Xcode Settings

   - Fill the form with:
     - URL: `https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai`
     - API Key: `Bearer <helicone-api-key>`
     - API Key Header: `Authorization`
     - Description: `Helicone` (you can name this however you like)

3) Confirm models are available

   - After saving, Xcode should list available models from Helicone
   - There are many models; use Favorites to pin the ones you use most

4) Start chatting and view logs in Helicone

   - Use the chat in Xcode with your selected model
   - Open the Helicone dashboard to see your requests, tokens, and costs

## Notes

- URL points to the Helicone AI Gateway. Your Helicone API key is sent via the `Authorization` header.
- If you don’t see models, verify your org/provider keys are set in Helicone and that your key has access.
