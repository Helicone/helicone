## Introduction

Crew AI is a multi-agent framework that simplifies the automation of complex workflows.

Integrating Helicone with Crew AI allows you to monitor AI-driven tasks and agent interactions effectively.

## Integration Steps

  <Step title="Create an account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set OPENAI_BASE_URL as an environment variable">

  <CodeGroup>

```python example.py
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = f"https://oai.helicone.ai/{HELICONE_API_KEY}/v1"
```

</CodeGroup>
