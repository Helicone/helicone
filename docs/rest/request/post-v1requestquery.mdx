The following API lets you get all of the requests
that would be visible in the request table at
[helicone.ai/requests](https://helicone.ai/requests).

### Filter

A filter is either a FilterLeaf or a FilterBranch, and can be composed of multiple filters generating an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) of ANDs/ORs.

Here is how it is represented in typescript:

```ts
export interface FilterBranch {
  left: FilterNode;
  operator: "or" | "and"; // Can add more later
  right: FilterNode;
}

export type FilterNode = FilterLeaf | FilterBranch | "all";
```

This allows us to build complex filters like this:

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "operator": "and",
    "right": {
      "request": {
        "model": {
          "contains": "gpt-4"
        }
      }
    },
    "left": {
      "request": {
        "user_id": {
          "equals": "abc@email.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
