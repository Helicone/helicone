description: "Returns all available multimodal models supported by Helicone AI Gateway (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)"
openapi: get /v1/models/multimodal
---

This endpoint returns a list of all multimodal AI models supported by the Helicone AI Gateway. Multimodal models are those that support more than one input modality (e.g., text + images) or more than one output modality. This is an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that follows the same response format as OpenAI's `/v1/models` endpoint.

Use this endpoint to discover which multimodal models are available for routing through the AI Gateway.

## Endpoint URL

```
https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai/v1/models/multimodal
```

## What Makes a Model Multimodal?

A model is considered multimodal if it meets either of these criteria:
- **Multiple Input Modalities**: Accepts more than one type of input (e.g., text, images, audio)
- **Multiple Output Modalities**: Produces more than one type of output (e.g., text, images, audio)

## Example Request

```bash
curl https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai/v1/models/multimodal
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 1747180800,
      "owned_by": "anthropic"
    },

      "owned_by": "google"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Use this endpoint as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's `/v1/models` endpoint with multimodal filtering
- **Multimodal Model Discovery**: Discover which multimodal models are available through Helicone AI Gateway
- **Vision/Audio Applications**: Find models that support image or audio inputs for your applications
- **Integration Testing**: Verify multimodal model availability for your applications
