This endpoint returns the complete catalog of AI models and provider endpoints that the Helicone AI Gateway can route to. The gateway uses this registry to determine which providers support a requested model and how to intelligently route requests for maximum reliability and cost optimization.

When you request a model through the AI Gateway (like `gpt-4o-mini`), the gateway consults this registry to find all providers offering that model, then applies routing logic to select the best provider based on your configuration, availability, and pricing.
