    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "generate a prompt for stable diffusion using this article.\n The prompt should instruct the image generation model to generate a image that would be suitable for the main image of the article.\n Therefore, the image should be relevant to the article, while being photorealistic, and safe for work.\n Only include the prompt, and do not include a introduction to the prompt. The entire prompt should be 90 characters or less. Make it as relevant to the image as possible, but do not include people or faces in the prompt."
        }
    ]
}'
```
