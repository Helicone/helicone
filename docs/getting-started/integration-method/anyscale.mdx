You can use Helicone with your OpenAI compatible models that are deployed on Anyscale.

Follow the Helicone integration as normal in the [proxy approach](/getting-started/integration-method/openai-proxy) but add the following header.

```bash
Helicone-OpenAI-API-Base: https://api.endpoints.anyscale.com/v1
```

This will route traffic through Helicone to your Anyscale deployment.
