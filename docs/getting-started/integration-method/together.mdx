title: "Together"

You can use Helicone with your OpenAI compatible models that are deployed on Together.

The integration is extremely similar to the [proxy approach](/getting-started/integration-method/openai-proxy). The only difference is you just change the base_url to the dedicated TogetherAI endpoint `https://together.hconeai.com/v1`.

```bash
base_url="http://together.hconeai.com/v1"
```
