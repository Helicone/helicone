title: "Together AI"

You can seamlessly integrate Helicone with your OpenAI compatible models that are deployed on Together AI.

The integration process closely mirrors the [proxy approach](/integrations/openai/javascript). The only distinction lies in the modification of the base_url to point to the dedicated TogetherAI endpoint `https://together.helicone.ai/v1`.

```bash
base_url="https://together.helicone.ai/v1"
```

Please ensure that the base_url is correctly set to ensure successful integration.
