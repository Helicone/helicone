# Gateway Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Helicone account">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Featherless AI account">
    Log into [Featherless AI](https://featherless.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an API key from your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set HELICONE_API_KEY and FEATHERLESS_API_KEY as environment variable">
```javascript
HELICONE_API_KEY=<your API key>
FEATHERLESS_API_KEY=<your API key>
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify the base URL and add Auth headers">

Replace the following Featherless AI URL with the Helicone Gateway URL:

`https://api.featherless.ai` -> `https://featherless.helicone.ai`

and then add the following authentication headers:

```javascript
Authorization: Bearer <your API key>
```

</Step>
</Steps>

Now you can access all the models on Featherless AI with a simple fetch call:

```bash
curl \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <FEATHERLESS_API_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the capital of France?"
      }
    ]
}' \
