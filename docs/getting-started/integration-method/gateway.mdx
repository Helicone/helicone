description: "The best way to integrate with Helicone is through our Gateway. It's a simple API that allows you to send requests and responses to Helicone."

# How it works

Gateway acts as a unified entry point for all traffic regardless of your provider. It allows you to send requests to any provider through a single endpoint.
This gives you the ability to leverage all of Helicone's features like

- [caching](/features/advanced-usage/caching.mdx)
- [logging](/docs/logging)
- [rate limiting](/docs/rate-limiting)
- And more!

`api.myllm-provider.ai` -> `gateway.hconeai.com`

- Header: `Helicone-Target-Url: https://api.myllm-provider.ai`
- Header: `Helicone-Target-Provider: myllm-provider`

Once we get the auto-mapper and the unapproved domains in a better spot we should show off how we can use the auto mapper
to quickly identify new models and their schemas

## Unapproved Domains

For unapproved domains, we want to protect our community from potential attack vectors.
Inorder to have a safe internet, you can use an unapproved domain by using the proxy, which
will be available soon.

- 10,000 requests per day
- 1 request per second
