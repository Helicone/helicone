The integration process closely mirrors the [proxy approach](/getting-started/integration-method/openai-proxy). The only distinction lies in the modification of the base_url to point to the dedicated Deepinfra endpoint `https://deepinfra.helicone.ai/v1`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set base_url for whatever client you are using">

    For more information on how to set the base_url for your client, please refer to the documentation of the client you are using.

  <CodeGroup>

```python example.py
base_url=f"https://deepinfra.helicone.ai/{HELICONE_API_KEY}/v1"
```

</CodeGroup>

Please ensure that the base_url is correctly set to ensure successful integration.
