title: "Gateway Fallback (Beta)"
description: "A unified gateway to utilize any provider through a single endpoint."
---
<Warning>**This feature is currently in beta.** While you're welcome to try it out, please know that our team is still working to refine it. Your feedback is valuable to help us improve! </Warning>
<Info>**Who can use this feature**: Anyone on any [plan](https://www.helicone.ai/pricing).</Info>

## Introduction

Given the instability of some APIs and the multitude of similar providers, we have developed a unified gateway that allows you to interact with any provider through a single endpoint. 

Instead of using the **`Helicone-Target-Url`** header to send requests to a specific API, you can use this unified gateway to: 
- automatically switch to fallback options in case of an API failure or error response
- eliminate the need to modify your code when switching providers.
- maintain high availability and reliability in critical applications that depend on external APIs.


## How it Works
To use this feature, provide a header named `Helicone-Fallbacks`. This header should contain a JSON string dump of the fallbacks you wish to use. The fallbacks are prioritized, meaning the first one will be used if available. If it is not available, the system will attempt to use the next one, and so on.

The structure for the `Helicone-Fallbacks` header is as follows:

```TypeScript
export type HeliconeFallbackCode = number | { from: number; to: number };

export type HeliconeFallback = {
  "target-url": string;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  onCodes: HeliconeFallbackCode[];
  bodyKeyOverride?: object;
};
```

### Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python w/o package">

The following example demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API. If it fails, the system will switch to the LemonFox API.

    ```python
    url = "https://gateway.hconeai.com/v1/chat/completions"

    headers = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Helicone-Auth": "Bearer <Helicone KEY>",
      "Helicone-Fallbacks": json.dumps([ # add this new header
          {   # this API will be used if available, otherwise, the system will use the next one
              "target-url": "https://api.openai.com",
              "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer <OpenAI Key>",
              },
              "onCodes": [{"from": 400, "to": 500}]
          },
          {   # set fallback to LemonFox API
              "target-url": "https://api.lemonfox.ai", 
              "headers": {
                  "Authorization": "Bearer <LemonFox Key>",
                  "Content-Type": "application/json",
              },
              "onCodes": [401, 403],
              "bodyKeyOverride": {
                  "model": "zephyr-chat",
              }
          },
      ]),
    }
    payload = {
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
      ],
      "max_tokens": 300
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    print("Fallback index used: ", response.headers["helicone-fallback-index"])
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.text)

    ```

## Limitations 

### Using Approved Domains
Helicone supports integration with several approved domains for providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Together-AI, OpenRouter, and Azure. Choosing from our [latest list of approved domains](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/blob/360221606ddcfb871920f7a54379cf82a5d883a5/costs/src/providers/mappings.ts#L15) as fallbacks means you can send **unlimited requests** to the providers via Helicone. 

### Using Unapproved Domains
You can also use unapproved domains as fallbacks. However, to protect our community from potential threats, we have certain restrictions for unapproved domains:
- 10,000 requests per day
- 1 request per second
