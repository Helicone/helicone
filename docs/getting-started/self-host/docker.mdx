At Helicone we believe that open-source software makes the world a better place. We are committed to open-source and we made a guide to make it easy for you to deploy your own instance of Helicone.

## Running locally

```
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

<Note>
  To create a user go to http://localhost:8989/project/default/auth/users and
  add your account. You can use this account to sign into Helicone at
  localhost:3000 via your browser.
</Note>

**Default URLs:**

- Helicone Webpage: localhost:3000
- Helicone Worker: localhost:8787

## Maintaining your instance

**Helicone container builds**

```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t helicone/supabase-migration-runner -f dockerfiles/dockerfile_migration_runner .
docker build -t helicone/worker -f dockerfiles/dockerfile_worker .
docker build -t helicone/web -f dockerfiles/dockerfile_web .
docker build -t helicone/clickhouse-migration-runner -f dockerfiles/dockerfile_clickhouse_migration_runner . --no-cache
```
