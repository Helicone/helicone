## Choosing the Right Deployment Option

To help you decide which deployment method suits you best, here's a brief overview:

- **Manual Installation**: Choose this if you need fine-grained control over each component and want to customize your setup extensively.

- **Docker Compose**: Ideal for quick setups, local development, or small-scale deployments without complex infrastructure requirements.

- **Kubernetes**: Suitable for large-scale deployments that require scalability and resilience. Opt for this if you're already using a Kubernetes cluster.

- **Cloud Deployment**: Best for production environments on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure, offering robustness and scalability.

## Getting Started

Follow the guide for your chosen deployment method to set up Helicone. If you're new to self-hosting, we recommend starting with Docker Compose for a quick and easy setup.
