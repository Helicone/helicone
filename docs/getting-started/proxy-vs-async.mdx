## Quick Compare

There are two ways to interface with Helicone - Proxy and Async. We will help you decide which one is right for you, and the pros and cons with each option.

## Proxy

The primary reason Helicone users choose to integrate with Helicone using Proxy is its **simple integration**.

It's as easy as changing the base URL to point to Helicone, and we'll forward the request to the LLM and return the response to you.

<Frame caption="Proxy: flow of data. ">
  <img src="/images/example-proxy.png" />
</Frame>

Since the proxy sits on the edge and is the gatekeeper of the requests, you get access to a suite of Gateway tools such as caching, rate limiting, API key management, threat detection, moderations and more.

<Accordion title="Here's a simple example">

    Instead of calling the OpenAI API with `api.openai.com`, you will change the URL to a Helicone dedicated domain `oai.helicone.ai`.

    You can also use the general Gateway URL `gateway.helicone.ai` if Helicone doesn't have a dedicated domain for the provider yet.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```python Dedicated domain example
    import openai

    # Set the API base URL to Helicone's proxy
    openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

    # Generate a chat completion request
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi!"}],
        headers={
            "Helicone-Auth": "Bearer [HELICONE_API_KEY]"  # Your Helicone API key
        }
    )

    print(response)
    ```

    ```python Other (Gateway example)
    import openai

    openai.api_base = "https://gateway.helicone.ai"  # Set the API base URL to Helicone Gateway
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="[DEPLOYMENT]",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi!"}],
        headers={
            "Helicone-Auth": "Bearer [HELICONE_API_KEY]",  # Your Helicone API key
            "Helicone-Target-Url": "https://api.lemonfox.ai",  # The target API URL
            "Helicone-Target-Provider": "LemonFox",  # The provider name
        }
    )
    print(response)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

## Async

Helicone Async allows for a more flexible workflow where the actual logging of the event is **not on the critical path**. This gives some users more confidence that if we are going down or if there is a network issue that it will not affect their application.

  <img src="/images/example-async.png" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  The downside is that we cannot offer the same suite of tools as we can with
  the proxy.
</Warning>

## Summary

### When to Use Proxy

- When you need a quick and easy setup.
- If you require Gateway features like custom rate limiting, caching, and retries.
- When you want to use tools that can be instrumented directly into the proxy.

### When to Use Async

- If you prefer the logging of events to be off the critical path, ensuring that network issues do not affect your application.
- When you need zero propagation delay.
