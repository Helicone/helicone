## Quick Compare

There are two ways to interface with Helicone - Proxy and Async. We will help you decide which one is right for you, and the pros and cons with each option.

## Proxy

**Simple integration** is the #1 reason Helicone users choose Proxy over Async. 

All you need to do is replace your call to the LLM with a call to the proxy. The proxy will then forward the request to the LLM and return the response to the user. Since the proxy sits on the edge and is the gatekeeper of the requests, you are able to access a suite of Gateway tools like `Caching`, `Backoff` and `Rate Limits` when you choose Proxy.

### When to use Proxy
- When you need a quick and easy setup.
- If you require Gateway features like custom rate limiting, caching, and retries.
- When you want to use tools that can be instrumented directly into the proxy.


**Example**

Instead of calling the OpenAI API with `api.openai.com`, you will change the URL to a Helicone dedicated domain `oai.hconeai.com`. 

You can also use the general Gateway URL `gateway.hconeai.com` if Helicone doesn't have a dedicated domain for the provider yet.  

<CodeGroup>
    
```python Dedicated domain example
import openai

# Set the API base URL to Helicone's proxy
openai.api_base = "https://oai.hconeai.com/v1"

# Generate a chat completion request
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi!"}],
    headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": "Bearer [HELICONE_API_KEY]"  # Your Helicone API key
    }
)

print(response)
```

```python Other (Gateway example)
import openai

openai.api_base = "https://gateway.hconeai.com"  # Set the API base URL to Helicone Gateway
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="[DEPLOYMENT]",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hi!"}],
    headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": "Bearer [HELICONE_API_KEY]",  # Your Helicone API key
        "Helicone-Target-Url": "https://api.lemonfox.ai",  # The target API URL
        "Helicone-Target-Provider": "LemonFox",  # The provider name
    }
)
print(response)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Async

Helicone Async allows for a more flexible workflow where the actual logging of the event is **not on the critical path**. This gives some users more confidence that if we are going down or if there is a network issue that it will not affect their application. 

<Warning>The downside is that we are not able to instrument the same suite of tools as we can with the proxy.</Warning>

### When to Use Async

- If you prefer the logging of events to be off the critical path, ensuring that network issues do not affect your application.
- When you need zero propagation delay.
