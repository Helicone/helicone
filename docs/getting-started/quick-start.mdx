Log your LLM requests, evaluate, and experiment with prompts, and get instant insights that helps you push changes to production with _confidence_. Helicone is the CI workflow designed for the entire LLM lifecycle.

## Quick Start

Welcome to Helicone! Integrate your preferred provider with Helicone in seconds.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create an account">
  Once you have an [account](https://helicone.ai/), proceed to the next step.
</Step>

  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Go to Settings" icon="square-1">
        Click on your organization on the top left, then select `Settings` from the dropdown.
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/introduction/key-step-1.webp"
            alt="Find Settings from Helicone's sidebar."
          />
        </Frame>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Select the API Keys tab" icon="square-2">
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/introduction/key-step-2.webp"
            alt="In Settings, select the API Keys tab."
          />
        </Frame>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Generate new key" icon="square-3">
        Click on `Generate new key`.

        When creating a new Helicone API key, you have the ability to enable `read` and `write` permissions.
        Write keys can be used through Helicone via our proxy, feedback or any other Helicone service when calling a `POST` or using our gateway.
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/introduction/key-step-3.webp"
            alt="Create a new Helicone API key from Settings."
          />
        </Frame>

        <Note>
          Keys with read permissions will start with `sk-` and keys with write
          permissions will start with `pk-`. For our EU customers, keys are generated
          with the prefix `eu-` this allows our edge workers to know which region to
          route the request to.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>
