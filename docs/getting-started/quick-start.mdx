<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do credits work?">
    Instead of managing API keys for each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), Helicone maintains the keys for you. You simply add credits to your account, and we handle the rest.

    **Benefits:**
    - **0% markup** - Pay exactly what providers charge, no hidden fees
    - No need to sign up for multiple LLM providers
    - Switch between [100+ models](https://helicone.ai/models) by just changing the model name
    - Automatic fallbacks if a provider is down
    - Unified billing across all providers

    Want more control? You can [bring your own provider keys](https://us.helicone.ai/providers) instead.
