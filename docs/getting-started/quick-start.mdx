"twitter:title": "Quickstart - Helicone Open Source LLM Observability"
---

Use the OpenAI SDK to access 100+ LLM models with automatic logging and observability.

<Accordion title="Using a third-party SDK?">
  The AI Gateway is our **recommended integration**, you get automatic fallbacks, 100+ models through one SDK, and seamless model switching.
  
  However, we understand you might already be deeply integrated with a third-party SDK.
  
  We support [direct integrations](/integrations/overview) for OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, and 20+ other providers. You'll still get full observability, just without the unified API benefits.
</Accordion>

## Quick Integration

Two steps to your first logged request:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Set up your keys">
  1. **Create an account**: [Sign up for free](https://helicone.ai/signup)
  2. **Helicone API Key**: Go to [API Keys](https://us.helicone.ai/settings/api-keys) and generate a new key
  3. **Provider Keys**: Add your LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) at [Provider Keys](https://us.helicone.ai/providers)
    
    <Note>
      The Helicone key authenticates with our gateway. Provider keys let you access the actual LLMs.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send your first request">

    Helicone's AI Gateway is an OpenAI-compatible, unified API with access to 100+ models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, Groq, and more.

    **Bring your own key:** Go to [Provider Keys](https://us.helicone.ai/providers) to securely store API keys for the providers you want to use.
