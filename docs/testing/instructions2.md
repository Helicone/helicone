# Documentation Rewrite Instructions

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:

This instructions.md file is your SOURCE OF TRUTH. In each loop of your work:
STATE: "I am working on [file name]"
REVIEW: Directly quote the specific section from instructions.md that applies to your current step
EXECUTE: Perform only the specific action described in that section
VERIFY: Check that your action exactly matches what instructions.md required
REPEAT: Return to step 1 for the next action

DO NOT deviate from instructions.md or skip any steps it contains.
After EVERY tool call, review the relevant section of instructions.md AGAIN before proceeding.
