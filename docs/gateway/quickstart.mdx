<Note>
  Helicone AI Gateway is currently only available as a self-hosted solution. 
  Our cloud-based solution is coming soon.
</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set up your AI Gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/gateway start
    ```

    The Gateway will be running on `http://localhost:8080` with sensible defaults.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure provider secrets">
        The Gateway centralizes management of your LLM provider credentials.

        We support OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini out of the box.

        Just add your API keys to the `.env` file:

        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
        export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
        export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
        ```

        Using other providers? Check how to add them [here](/gateway/config/#provider-configuration).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Make your first request">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Typescript
    import { OpenAI } from "openai";

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: "http://localhost:8080"
    });

    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini", // 100+ models available
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello, world!" }],
    });

    console.log(response);
    ```
    ```python Python
    import openai

    openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8080"
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",  # 100+ models available
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
    )
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    You're all set! 🎉 
    
    Your AI Gateway is now ready to handle requests across 100+ AI models!
    </Step>
    <Step title="Optional: Enable Helicone observability">
