# Retry Configuration

Automatic retry logic for failed requests with configurable strategies and backoff patterns to improve reliability and handle transient failures gracefully.

## Why Use Retries?

Retries improve reliability by:
- **Handling temporary provider outages** or network issues
- **Reducing error rates** from transient failures
- **Providing graceful degradation** during high load periods

## How It Works

When a request fails, the gateway waits according to the backoff strategy before retrying. Exponential backoff increases wait times between retries to avoid overwhelming providers that may be experiencing issues.

## Configuration Options

### Basic Retry Setup

```yaml
routers:
  production:
    retries:
      enabled: true
      max-retries: 3
      strategy: exponential
      base: 1s
      max: 30s
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Description | Default |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | boolean | Enable or disable retry logic | `false` |
| `max-retries` | integer | Maximum retry attempts (0-255) | `3` |
| `strategy` | string | Backoff strategy (`exponential`) | `exponential` |
| `base` | duration | Initial retry delay | `1s` |
| `max` | duration | Maximum delay between retries | `30s` |

### Exponential Backoff

With exponential backoff, each retry waits progressively longer:

- **First retry**: Wait `base` duration (e.g., 1s)
- **Second retry**: Wait `base * 2` (e.g., 2s)  
- **Third retry**: Wait `base * 4` (e.g., 4s)
- **Maximum**: Never exceed `max` duration (e.g., 30s)

This prevents overwhelming providers while still providing multiple retry attempts for transient issues.

## Best Practices

1. **Start conservatively** - Begin with 3 retries and adjust based on provider behavior
2. **Set reasonable maximums** - Avoid delays longer than your application's timeout
3. **Monitor retry rates** - High retry rates may indicate provider issues or configuration problems
4. **Consider provider limits** - Some providers may have specific retry policies

## When Retries Occur

The gateway automatically retries requests for:
- **Network timeouts** and connection errors
- **Provider rate limit responses** (429 status codes)
- **Server errors** (5xx status codes)
- **Temporary unavailability** responses

Retries do **not** occur for:
- **Authentication errors** (401, 403)
- **Bad requests** (400, 422)
- **Not found errors** (404)
- **Client errors** that indicate permanent issues

## Monitoring Retry Behavior

Track retry metrics to optimize your configuration:
- **Retry rate** - Percentage of requests that required retries
- **Retry success rate** - How often retries succeed
- **Average retry count** - Typical number of retries per failed request
- **Retry latency** - Additional time from retry delays

High retry rates may indicate:
- Provider instability
- Network issues
- Aggressive retry configuration
- Need for different load balancing strategy
