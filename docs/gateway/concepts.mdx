## Multi-Router Architecture

**Key Concept:** Unlike other gateways that support only one router per deployment, Helicone AI Gateway supports **multiple routers in a single deployment**. This gives you two deployment options:

- **Multiple routers, one deployment**: Define several routers (e.g., `default`, `experimental`, `cost-optimized`) in one `config.yaml`. When making requests, specify the router in your URL: `/v1/chat/completions?router=experimental`
- **One router, multiple deployments**: Deploy separate gateway instances, each with its own router configuration for complete isolation

This flexibility lets you test different configurations, segment traffic, or serve different use cases from the same gateway instance.
