---

Helicone Credits provide a simple, transparent way to pay for LLM usage across all providers through the AI Gateway. No subscriptions, no commitments. Just add credits and use any model with automatic cost tracking.

<Info>
**Beta**: Credits is currently in beta. [Join the waitlist](https://helicone.ai/credits) to get early access for your organization.

## How Credits Work

Credits act as a unified billing system for all your LLM usage through the AI Gateway. Whether you're using GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, or any of the 100+ supported models, costs are automatically deducted from your credit balance.

## Supported Models & Pricing

All pricing is based on our comprehensive [Model Registry](https://helicone.ai/models), which tracks real-time pricing for 100+ models across multiple providers.

### Popular Models

The AI Gateway automatically routes to the most cost-effective provider for each model:

| Model | Starting Price | Providers |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| GPT-4o Mini | $0.15/1M tokens | OpenAI, Azure, AWS Bedrock |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00/1M tokens | Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex |
| Gemini 1.5 Flash | $0.075/1M tokens | Google AI, Google Vertex |
| Llama 3.1 8B | $0.18/1M tokens | Together, Fireworks, Groq |

<Note>
Prices shown are input token costs. Output tokens and provider-specific pricing may vary. Visit [helicone.ai/models](https://helicone.ai/models) for complete, up-to-date pricing.
</Note>

## Integration Methods

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) - Available Now

Use your existing provider API keys through the gateway:

```typescript
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai",
  apiKey: process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY,
});

// Your provider keys are used for the actual API calls
// Credits track usage for unified billing and analytics
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }]
});
```

### PTB (Pass-Through Billing) - Coming Soon

<Warning>
Pass-Through Billing is not yet available. Currently, you need your own provider API keys (BYOK).
</Warning>

Use Helicone's API keys and pay only through credits:

```typescript
// Coming soon - no provider keys needed
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }]
  // Cost automatically deducted from credits
});
```

## Cost Optimization Features

### Automatic Provider Selection

The gateway automatically selects the cheapest available provider for each model:

1. **Cost-first routing** - Always attempts the lowest-cost provider first
2. **Smart fallbacks** - If the cheapest fails, tries the next cheapest
3. **Real-time pricing** - Uses up-to-date pricing from the Model Registry

### Advanced Cost Tracking

Credits integrate with Helicone's comprehensive cost tracking features:

### Caching for Cost Reduction

Enable [caching](/features/advanced-usage/caching) to eliminate redundant API calls:

```typescript
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Frequently asked question" }]
}, {
  headers: {
    "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=3600"
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

### Development vs Production

Use different environments to control costs:

```typescript
headers: {
  "Helicone-Property-Environment": process.env.NODE_ENV,
  "Helicone-Property-UserTier": userTier
}
```

### Monitor Unit Economics

Track costs per user action to understand your business metrics:

```typescript
headers: {
  "Helicone-Session-Id": `support-${ticketId}`,
  "Helicone-Session-Name": "Customer Support",
  "Helicone-Property-UserTier": "premium"
}
```
