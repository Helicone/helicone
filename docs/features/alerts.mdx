Monitor error rates and costs to catch issues before they impact users. Helicone's alert system provides real-time notifications when your LLM applications experience problems, helping you maintain reliability and control costs.

## Alert Types

### Error Rate Alerts
Track the percentage of failed requests over a time window. Essential for maintaining application reliability.

**Use cases:**
- Detect provider outages or rate limiting issues
- Catch breaking changes in prompts or model behavior  
- Monitor deployment health after updates
- Identify patterns in user inputs causing failures

**Example:** Alert when error rate exceeds 5% over 30 minutes with at least 20 requests.

### Cost Alerts
Monitor spending to prevent budget overruns and detect unusual usage patterns.

**Use cases:**
- Prevent unexpected bills from runaway processes
- Track per-environment spending (dev/staging/prod)
- Detect potential abuse or misconfiguration
- Monitor cost trends for specific features or users

**Example:** Alert when daily spending exceeds \$1000 or when hourly spending exceeds \$100.

## Creating Alerts

Navigate to **Settings â†’ Alerts** in your Helicone dashboard to create new alerts.

  </Frame>
  
  **Error Rate Alerts:**
  - Percentage threshold: 1-100% (5-10% recommended for production)
  - Tracks ratio of failed requests to total requests
  - Failed requests include 4xx/5xx errors and timeouts
  
  **Cost Alerts:**
  - Dollar amount threshold (e.g., $50, $500, $1000)
  - Tracks cumulative spend within time window
  - Includes all model costs across providers
</Step>

<Step title="Configure time window">  
  Choose how long to evaluate the metric:
  
  - **5-15 minutes**: Immediate detection, higher false positive rate
  - **30-60 minutes**: Balanced approach (recommended for most apps)
  - **2-4 hours**: Sustained issues only, fewer false positives
  - **Daily/Weekly**: Budget tracking and long-term trends
  
  <Note>
  Shorter windows detect issues faster but may trigger during brief spikes. Longer windows reduce noise but delay detection.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Set minimum request threshold">
  Prevent false positives during low traffic periods:
  
  - **Development**: 5-10 requests minimum
  - **Staging**: 10-20 requests minimum  
  - **Production**: 20-50 requests minimum
  
  Alerts only trigger when both the threshold AND minimum requests are met.
  
  <Warning>
  Always set a minimum request count to avoid alert fatigue. A single failed request during low traffic shouldn't trigger a 100% error rate alert.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure notifications">
  Choose where alerts are sent:
  
  - **Email**: Add any email address (immediate delivery)
  - **Slack**: Select connected channels (#alerts, #engineering, etc.)
  - **Multiple recipients**: Add several emails or channels per alert
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with conservative thresholds (higher error %, longer windows) and tighten based on actual patterns. This prevents alert fatigue while you learn your app's normal behavior.

## Notification Channels

### Dashboard
All alerts appear in your Helicone dashboard with real-time status updates. When an alert triggers, you can immediately see affected requests and investigate the issue.

    alt="Dashboard view when an alert has been triggered showing affected requests"
  />
</Frame>

### Email Notifications
Add any email address to receive alerts. Emails include:
- Alert type and threshold that triggered
- Current metric value and trend
- Direct link to affected requests in dashboard
- Time window and request count

  />
</Frame>

### Slack Integration
When creating or editing an alert:
1. Select **Slack** as the notification method
2. Click **Connect Slack** button that appears
3. Authorize Helicone in your Slack workspace
4. Select a channel from the dropdown (#alerts, #engineering, etc.)

After connecting, you can simply select any channel from your workspace. Slack messages include the same details as emails with rich formatting and direct links to view affected requests.

## Configuration Examples

```yaml
# Critical error detection
metric: error_rate
threshold: 10%
time_window: 10min
min_requests: 20
notify: [#incidents, oncall@company.com]

# Sustained error monitoring  
metric: error_rate
threshold: 5%
time_window: 30min
min_requests: 50
notify: #engineering

# Daily cost tracking
metric: cost
threshold: $1000
time_window: 24h
notify: [#finance, cto@company.com]
```

### Development Environment

```yaml
# Loose thresholds for dev
metric: error_rate
threshold: 25%
time_window: 60min
min_requests: 5
notify: dev-team@company.com

# Weekly budget check
metric: cost

```


## Advanced Features (Coming Soon)

Soon you'll be able to create massively customizable alerts:

- **Custom aggregations** - Alert on any metric (P95 latency, token usage, specific error codes)
- **Advanced filters** - Combine multiple [custom properties](/observability/custom-properties) with AND/OR logic
- **Complex thresholds** - Percentage changes, rolling averages, anomaly detection
- **Custom webhooks** - Send alerts to any endpoint

These features will enable precise monitoring for specific user segments, features, or any custom criteria you define.
