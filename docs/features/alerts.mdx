Stay ahead of production issues with intelligent alerts that notify you when your LLM applications experience problems. Monitor error rates, cost spikes, and performance issues in real-time.

## Why Use Alerts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Catch Issues Early" icon="bell">
  Get notified the moment error rates spike or costs exceed budgets
</Card>
<Card title="Prevent Downtime" icon="shield">
  Respond to problems before they impact your users
</Card>
<Card title="Control Costs" icon="dollar-sign">
  Set spending limits and get alerts when you approach budgets
</Card>
<Card title="Peace of Mind" icon="heart">
  Sleep better knowing you'll be alerted to any production issues

## Alert Types

### Error Rate Alerts

Monitor the percentage of failed requests over time:

- **Best for**: Detecting model failures, rate limiting, or integration issues
- **Threshold**: Percentage (0-100%) of requests that are failing
- **Example**: "Alert me when error rate exceeds 5% over 10 minutes"

### Cost Alerts

Track spending and get notified when costs exceed limits:

- **Best for**: Budget monitoring, unexpected usage spikes, runaway processes  
- **Threshold**: Dollar amount spent in the time window
- **Example**: "Alert me when costs exceed $100 in 1 hour"

## Creating Alerts

### Access Alerts

Navigate to **Settings → Alerts** in your Helicone dashboard to manage all your alerts.

### Alert Configuration

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose your metric">
  Select what you want to monitor:
  - **Error Rate** - Percentage of failed requests
  - **Cost** - Total spending in dollars
</Step>

<Step title="Set your threshold">  
  Define when the alert should trigger:
  - **Error Rate**: Enter percentage (e.g., 5 for 5% error rate)
  - **Cost**: Enter dollar amount (e.g., 50 for $50 spending)
</Step>

<Step title="Pick time window">
  Choose how long to monitor before alerting:
  - **5-15 minutes** - Immediate issue detection
  - **30 minutes - 1 hour** - Sustained problem detection  
  - **1 day - 1 week** - Budget and trend monitoring
</Step>

<Step title="Set minimum requests">
  Avoid false positives by requiring a minimum number of requests in the time window before alerting
  
  *Example: Require at least 10 requests to avoid alerting on low traffic periods*
</Step>

<Step title="Configure notifications">
  Choose how to be notified when alerts trigger
</Step>
</Steps>

## Notification Setup

### Email Notifications

**Built-in option** - Works immediately with any email address:

- Select team members from your organization
- Add custom email addresses for external stakeholders
- Multiple recipients supported per alert

### Slack Notifications

**Requires integration** - More powerful for team collaboration:

<Steps>
<Step title="Connect Slack">
  1. Go to Settings → Integrations  
  2. Click "Connect Slack"
  3. Authorize Helicone to access your Slack workspace
</Step>

<Step title="Choose channels">
  - Select specific channels for different alert types
  - Use #alerts for general notifications
  - Use #engineering for error alerts
  - Use #finance for cost alerts
</Step>
</Steps>

## Time Window Selection

Choose the right monitoring period for different scenarios:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Immediate Issues">
  **5-15 minutes** for urgent problems:
  - Production API failures
  - Authentication errors  
  - Critical feature outages
  
  *Quick detection but may have false positives*
</Tab>

<Tab title="Sustained Problems">
  **30 minutes - 1 hour** for persistent issues:
  - Model performance degradation
  - Rate limit patterns
  - Gradual service degradation
  
  *Balanced approach - catches real issues, fewer false alarms*
</Tab>

<Tab title="Budget Monitoring">  
  **1 day - 1 week** for spending oversight:
  - Daily budget limits
  - Weekly cost tracking
  - Monthly spending reviews
  
  *Long-term monitoring for financial control*
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

### Setting Thresholds

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Error Rate Thresholds">
  **Start conservative, adjust based on your baseline:**
  
  - **5-10%** for new applications (catch issues early)
  - **2-5%** for stable production apps  
  - **1-2%** for critical business functions
  
  *Review your historical error rates to set realistic thresholds*
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cost Thresholds">  
  **Base on your usage patterns and budgets:**
  
  - **Daily limits**: 120-150% of typical daily spend
  - **Hourly limits**: 200-300% of typical hourly spend
  - **Emergency limits**: Hard stops at budget boundaries
  
  *Account for traffic spikes, new features, and seasonal patterns*
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Avoiding Alert Fatigue

- **Use minimum request counts** to prevent low-traffic false positives
- **Start with longer time windows** (30+ minutes) and decrease as needed  
- **Set different thresholds for different times** (higher tolerance during low usage)
- **Group related alerts** instead of creating many individual ones
- **Review and adjust** thresholds based on actual alert patterns

## Common Alert Scenarios

### Production Error Monitoring

```
Alert Name: Production API Errors
Metric: Error Rate  
Threshold: 5%
Time Window: 10 minutes
Minimum Requests: 20
Notifications: #engineering slack channel + on-call email
```

**Use case**: Catch API failures, model errors, or integration issues quickly

### Cost Spike Detection

```
Alert Name: Hourly Spending Limit  
Metric: Cost
Threshold: $200
Time Window: 1 hour  
Minimum Requests: 1
Notifications: Engineering lead + finance team
```

**Use case**: Detect runaway processes, unexpected usage, or billing anomalies

### Weekend/Low-Traffic Monitoring

```
Alert Name: Weekend Error Check
Metric: Error Rate
Threshold: 15%  
Time Window: 2 hours
Minimum Requests: 5
Notifications: Email only (less urgent)
```

**Use case**: Monitor during low-traffic periods with adjusted thresholds

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Properties Integration

Alerts work with your existing [custom properties](/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties) filtering:

- Alerts monitor **all requests** that match your current filters
- Use properties to create environment-specific alerts
- Filter by user tiers, features, or regions for targeted monitoring

*Example: Set up separate alerts for production vs staging environments*

### Multiple Alert Strategy

Create layered alerts for comprehensive monitoring:

1. **Immediate alerts** (5-15 min) for critical errors
2. **Sustained alerts** (30-60 min) for ongoing issues  
3. **Budget alerts** (daily/weekly) for cost control
4. **Trend alerts** (weekly/monthly) for performance monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many False Positives

- **Increase minimum request count** - Require more requests before alerting
- **Extend time window** - Use longer periods to smooth out noise
- **Adjust thresholds** - Review actual error rates and set realistic limits
- **Add filters** - Use custom properties to exclude test traffic

### Missing Important Issues

- **Decrease thresholds** - Lower the bar for triggering alerts
- **Shorten time windows** - Detect issues faster with shorter monitoring periods
- **Check minimum requests** - Ensure you're not requiring too many requests
- **Review notification setup** - Verify emails and Slack integrations

### Slack Integration Issues

- **Reconnect integration** - Refresh the Slack connection in Settings
- **Check channel permissions** - Ensure Helicone can post to selected channels
- **Verify channel names** - Double-check channel selection in alert configuration
- **Test with email first** - Confirm alerts work via email before troubleshooting Slack

Alerts are your early warning system for production LLM applications. Start with basic error and cost monitoring, then refine your thresholds as you learn your application's normal behavior patterns.
