Helicone Alerts let you monitor error rates and costs on LLM requests to catch issues before they impact users. Each alert can be configured with filters and automatically notify through channels like Slack or email.

## Alert Types

| Alert Type | Description | Use Cases |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Error Rate** | Track the percentage of failed requests (4XX/5XX errors or timeouts) over a time window | Detect provider outages, catch breaking changes in prompts, monitor deployment health, identify patterns in user inputs causing failures |
| **Cost** | Monitor spending to prevent budget overruns and detect unusual usage patterns | Prevent unexpected bills, track per-environment spending, detect potential abuse, monitor cost trends for specific features or users |

## Creating Alerts

Navigate to **Settings → Alerts** in your Helicone dashboard to create new alerts.

        style={{ width: "100%" }}
      />
    </div>
  </Frame>
  
  Select the alert type (error rate or cost), set your threshold, choose a time window, optionally add filters, and configure minimum request thresholds.
</Step>

        style={{ width: "100%" }}
      />
    </div>
  </Frame>
  
  Choose where alerts are sent:
  
  - **Email**: Add any email address (immediate delivery)
  - **Slack**: Select connected channels (#alerts, #engineering, etc.)
  - **Multiple recipients**: Add several emails or channels per alert
  
  <Tip>
  Start with conservative thresholds (higher error %, longer windows) and tighten based on actual patterns. This prevents alert fatigue while you learn your app's normal behavior.
  </Tip>

    <img
      src="/images/alerts/alert-page.webp"
      alt="Helicone alerts dashboard with list of configured alerts"
    />
  </Frame>
  
  View all configured alerts, their current status, and recent trigger history in the dashboard. When an alert triggers, you can immediately see affected requests and investigate the issue.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

Each alert can be configured with the following options:

- **Metric** - Choose between error rate or cost
- **Threshold** - Percentage for error rate (e.g., 5-10% for production), dollar amount for cost (e.g., $100, $1000)
- **Time Frame** - Evaluation window (e.g., last 30 minutes, last 24 hours, last 30 days)
- **Min Requests** - Optional minimum request count to prevent false positives during low traffic periods
- **Filter** - Allows for complex alerts with full control over properties and all available metadata. Uses the same filter system as the Requests page. Examples: filter by model, token counts, custom properties, provider, endpoint, and more

## Targeted Monitoring with Filters

Each alert can watch a specific slice of your traffic. Use the filter builder when creating or editing an alert to narrow the scope by provider, model, environment, or any custom properties you've set. For example, create a cost alert that only tracks Anthropic requests, or isolate prompts tagged with a certain property value to validate new functionality before rolling it out broadly.

You can also filter the Alerts list itself to quickly review production-critical rules versus experimental ones.

## Notification Channels

### Email Notifications
Add any email address to receive alerts. Emails include:
- Alert type and threshold that triggered
- Current metric value and trend
- Direct link to affected requests in dashboard
- Time window and request count

</Frame>

### Slack Integration
When creating or editing an alert:
1. Select **Slack** as the notification method
2. Click **Connect Slack** button that appears
3. Authorize Helicone in your Slack workspace
4. Select a channel from the dropdown (#alerts, #engineering, etc.)

After connecting, you can simply select any channel from your workspace. Slack messages include the same details as emails with rich formatting and direct links to view affected requests.

## Configuration Examples

### Production Monitoring

```yaml
# Critical error detection
metric: error_rate
threshold: 10%
time_window: 10min
min_requests: 20
notify: [#incidents, oncall@company.com]

# Sustained error monitoring  
metric: error_rate
threshold: 5%
time_window: 30min
min_requests: 50
notify: #engineering

# Daily cost tracking
metric: cost
threshold: $1000
time_window: 24h
notify: [#finance, cto@company.com]
```

### Development Environment

```yaml
# Loose thresholds for dev
metric: error_rate
threshold: 25%
time_window: 60min
min_requests: 5
notify: dev-team@company.com

# Weekly budget check
metric: cost
threshold: $100
time_window: 7d
notify: #dev-alerts
```
