<Warning>This feature is currently in Beta. Use it at your own risk.</Warning>
<Accordion title="How does it work?">

We are currently utilizing an adapted version of JSX to manage prompts and their input variables.
You can send over a prompt with the following syntax:

```tsx
<helicone-prompt-input key="my_input_key">
  Input to your LLM
</helicone-prompt-input>
```

Within the proxy, we extract the `children` text from the JSX element `helicone-prompt-input` and replace it before it is sent to your LLM.
This results in the following string being sent over to your LLM:

```tsx
    Input to your LLM
```

Then, all of the variables are mapped within the UI as a dictionary like:

```json
{
  "my_input_key": "Input to your LLM"
}
```

<Note>
  It is crucial that each key has a unique identifier; otherwise, you will get the
  same variable replacing in multiple places.
</Note>
</Accordion>

## Prerequisites

You must have Helicone set up in proxy mode via
[Gateway](/getting-started/integration-method/gateway) or [custom package](/getting-started/integration-method/openai-proxy).

Read [Proxy vs Async](/getting-started/proxy-vs-async) to learn more about the differences between proxy and async integrations.

You must be using Helicone via Proxy. If you are not, please refer to our [Quick Start Async](/features/prompts/quick-start-async).

    ## TS/JS Quick Start
    ``` tsx
    // 1. Add this line
    import { hprompt } from "@helicone/helicone";

    const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
      {
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            // 2: Add hprompt to any string, and nest any variable in additional brackets `{}`
            content: hprompt`Write a story about ${{ scene }}`,
          },
        ],
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      },
      {
        // 3. Add Prompt Id Header
        headers: {
          "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
        },
      }
    );
    ```


    ## Step by Step
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add hprompt">

      ```ts
      import { hprompt } from "@helicone/helicone";
      ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Replace any text input">

      Using the backtick string formatter in JavaScript, add `hprompt` in front of your backtick to automatically format your text so that Helicone can determine where your variables are.

      Also, nest your inputted variable so that it is within another bracket `{}`, this is essentially
      making it so that we can determine the `input key` for Helicone.

      ```tsx
      content: hprompt`Write a story about ${{ scene }}`,
      ```

      <Accordion title="Change Input Name">
        If you want to rename your input or have a custom input, you can change the key-value pair in the passed dictionary to the string formatter function. Like this:

        ```tsx
        content: hprompt`Write a story about ${{ "my_magical_input": scene  }}`,
        ```
      </Accordion>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Tag your prompt and assign an id">
        Assign a `Helicone-Prompt-Id` header to your LLM request.

        Assigning an id allows us to associate your prompt with future versions of your prompt, and automatically manage versions on your behalf.

        Depending on the package you are using, you will need to add a header. For more information on adding headers to packages, please see [Helicone Headers](/helicone-headers).

        ```tsx
        headers: {
          "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
        },
        ```

      </Step>


    </Steps>

  <Tab title="Packageless (curl)">
  Let's say we have an app that generates a short story with an inputted scene.
  
  For example: "Write a story about a secret agent"

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Determine your input variables">
    ```ts
    Write a story about a secret agent
    ```

    Given the above string, let's say `a secret agent` is our inputted variable.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a key name for your inputted variable">
    Since we have a scene, let's call our key `scene`.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace">
    Now within your prompt, replace your string with the following. Don't worry, Helicone will remove this for you before it sends it to your LLM.

    Add `<helicone-input-prompt key="<INPUT_ID>" >` before your input and `</helicone-input-prompt>` after your input.

    ```tsx
    Write a story about <helicone-input-prompt key="scene" >a secret agent</helicone-input-prompt>
    ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Tag your prompt">

      In order to securely ensure that we know when and how to parse and categorize your prompt, please append the following header to your LLM request.
      `Helicone-Prompt-Id: you_prompt_id`.

      <Note>
      The id must not include any spaces or special characters. Underscores and dashes are acceptable.
      </Note>

    </Step>
    <Step title="Make a request">

      Now when you make your request to your LLM, the LLM will receive the prompt with all of the `helicone-input-prompt` tags removed. However, Helicone will now keep track of all of your inputs for you.
    </Step>

  </Steps>
  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other">
    Currently, we only support packages for TypeScript and JavaScript for easy integration. For now, we recommend manually implementing input variables like this:

    ```python
    openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      model="[DEPLOYMENT]",
      # Manually add starting and ending tags with before and after variables
      messages=[{"role": "User", "content": f'Write a story about <helicone-prompt-input key="scene" >{scene} </helicone-prompt-input>'}],
      headers={
        # Add Prompt Id header
        "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "Bearer [HELICONE_API_KEY]",
      }
    )
    ```
