## Version Control for Your Prompts

Take full control of your prompt versions:

- Track versions automatically in code or manually in UI
- Switch, promote, or rollback versions instantly
- Deploy any version using just the prompt ID

## Auto-Improve (Beta)

We're excited to launch Auto-Improve, an intelligent prompt optimization tool that helps you write more effective LLM prompts. While traditional prompt engineering requires extensive trial and error, Auto-Improve analyzes your prompts and suggests improvements instantly.

### How it Works

1. Click the Auto-Improve button in the Helicone Prompt Editor
2. Our AI analyzes each sentence of your prompt to understand:
   - The semantic interpretation
   - Your instructional intent
   - Potential areas for enhancement
3. Get a new suggested optimized version of your prompt

### Key Benefits

- **Semantic Analysis**: Goes beyond simple text improvements by understanding the purpose behind each instruction
- **Maintains Intent**: Preserves your original goals while enhancing how they're communicated
- **Time Saving**: Skip hours of prompt iteration and testing
- **Learning Tool**: Understand what makes an effective prompt by comparing your original with the improved version

## Using Prompts in Your Code

If you've created a prompt in the UI, you can use the [Generate API](/features/prompts/generate) for a simplified integration that works with multiple LLM providers.
