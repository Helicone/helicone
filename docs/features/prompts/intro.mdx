Helicone's prompt management is a really easy way for users to
keep track of the prompt they use when calling their generative AI application.
Helicone can automatically keep track of versions and inputs as they change.

### How it works

```tsx
const location = "space";
const scene = "two brothers";
const promptInput = hprompt`
Write a movie scene about ${{ scene }}, where they are on ${{ location }}
`;
```

As you change your prompt a new version will automatically be added and kept track of withint Helicone.
Also a dataset of input/output keys will be kept for each version as well.
