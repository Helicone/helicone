Helicone's prompt management provides a seamless way for users to track the prompts used when operating their generative AI applications. With Helicone, you can effortlessly monitor versions and inputs as they evolve.

### How it Works

```tsx
const location = "space";
const scene = "two brothers";
const promptInput = hprompt()`
Compose a movie scene involving ${{ scene }}, set in ${{ location }}
`;
```

As you modify your prompt, Helicone automatically adds a new version and maintains a record of it. Additionally, a dataset of input/output keys is preserved for each version.
