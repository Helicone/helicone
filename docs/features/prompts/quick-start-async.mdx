<Warning>This feature is in Beta, please use at your own risk.</Warning>
<Note>
  <b>
    We highly recommend using our{" "}
    <u>[proxy integration for prompts](/features/prompts/quick-start)</u> , it
    is significantly easier to get up and running!
  </b>
</Note>

This guide is written from the standpoint that you are using the
[custom integration method](/getting-started/integration-method/custom) or async version of Helicone.
To learn more please read [Proxy vs Async](/getting-started/proxy-vs-async).

If you are using the async libraries, it is significantly harder to get everything setup.
If you'd like us to add better support for this please email us at [engineering@helicone.ai](mailto:engineering@helicone.ai).

## Async Get Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the request id from your logged request">

### Option 1: Predefine

You will need to get the helicone request id for the request that you are logging.

The easiest way to do this is to define before hand.

```ts
const requestId = uuidv4(); // must be a valid UUID
```

Then when you make your request, you can add the request id via the `providerRequest.meta` tag like this.

```ts
meta: {
  `Helicone-Request-Id: ${requestId}`;
}
```

### Option 2: Fetch it after the fact

You can also fetch your requestId after the fact via call backs within the async SDKs like this...

```ts
onLog: async (response: Response) => {
  const heliconeId = response.headers.get("helicone-id");
},
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto detect your template inputs">

```ts
const promptId = "my_prompt_id";
const res = await fetch(
  `https://api.hconeai.com/v1/request/${requestId}/prompt/${promptId}/inputs`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${heliconeApiKey}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      inputs: inputs,
    }),
  }
);
```

  </Step>
    <Step title="(Optional) Explicitly define your template">

```ts
const promptId = "my_prompt_id";
const res = await fetch(
  `https://api.hconeai.com/v1/request/${requestId}/prompt/${promptId}/inputs`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${heliconeApiKey}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      inputs: inputs,
      inputTemplate: {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: `What you were already sending to openai <helicone-input-prompt key="my_input"/>`,
          },
        ],
      },
    }),
  }
);
```

  </Step>
</Steps>
