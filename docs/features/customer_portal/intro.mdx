# Getting access

You can get access to Helicone's Customer Portal ver quickly by following [these intructions](https://helicone.ai/sales?customer-portal=true).
Right now our customer portal is not supported by our self-serve model.

# Who is this for?

- Do you have clients that you are billing via usage? Maybe you have an LLM app, where you charge your customers based on the number of tokens and also want to provide them with a rich billing dashboard where they can see their requests.
- Companies hosting their own models and want to provide their customers with a rich dashboard where they can see their usage.
