## Creating Datasets

### From the Requests Page

The easiest way to create datasets is by selecting requests from your logs:

<Steps>
<Step title="Filter your requests">
  Use [custom properties](/observability/custom-properties) and filters to find the requests you want
  
  <Frame>
    <img 
      src="/images/datasets/filters.webp" 
      alt="Filtering requests with custom properties and search criteria"
    />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Select requests">
  Check the boxes next to requests you want to include in your dataset
  
  <Frame>
    <img 
      src="/images/datasets/datasets-select.webp" 
      alt="Selecting multiple requests to add to dataset"
    />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add to dataset">
  Click "Add to Dataset" and choose to create a new dataset or add to an existing one
  
  <Frame>
    <img 
      src="/images/datasets/dataset-add.webp" 
      alt="Adding selected requests to a dataset"
    />
  </Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Via API

Create datasets programmatically for automated workflows:

```typescript
// Create a new dataset
const response = await fetch('https://api.helicone.ai/v1/helicone-dataset', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Customer Support Examples',
    description: 'High-quality support interactions for fine-tuning'
  })
});

const dataset = await response.json();

// Add requests to the dataset
await fetch(`https://api.helicone.ai/v1/helicone-dataset/${dataset.id}/request/${requestId}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}`
  }
});
```

## Building Quality Datasets

### The Curation Process

Transform raw requests into high-quality training data through careful curation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Collect broadly, then filter">
Start by adding many potential examples, then narrow down to the best ones. It's easier to remove than to find examples later.
</Step>

<Step title="Review each example">
<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/datasets/datasets-edit.webp" 
    alt="Dataset curation interface showing request details for review"
  />
</Frame>

Examine each request/response pair for:
- **Accuracy** - Is the response correct and helpful?
- **Consistency** - Does it match the style and format you want?
- **Completeness** - Does it fully address the user's request?
</Step>

<Step title="Remove poor examples">
Delete any examples that are:
- Incorrect or misleading responses
- Off-topic or irrelevant
- Inconsistent with your desired behavior
- Edge cases that might confuse the model
</Step>

<Step title="Balance your dataset">
Ensure you have:
- Examples covering all common use cases
- Both simple and complex queries
- Appropriate distribution matching real usage
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Quality beats quantity** - 50-100 carefully curated examples often outperform thousands of uncurated ones. Focus on consistency and correctness over volume.
</Note>

### Dataset Dashboard

Access all your datasets at [helicone.ai/datasets](https://us.helicone.ai/datasets):

<Frame caption="Manage all your curated datasets in one place">

  />
</Frame>

From the dashboard you can:
- **Track progress** - Monitor dataset size and last updated time
- **Access datasets** - Click to view and curate contents
- **Export data** - Download datasets when ready for fine-tuning
- **Maintain quality** - Regularly review and improve your collections

## Exporting Data

### Export Formats

Download your datasets in various formats:

<Frame caption="Export options for downloading your dataset">
  <img 
    src="/images/datasets/datasets-export.webp" 
    alt="Dataset export dialog showing different format options"
  />
</Frame>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Fine-Tuning (JSONL)">
  Perfect for OpenAI fine-tuning format:
  
  ```json
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"}]}
  {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Help me"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd be happy to help!"}]}
  ```
  
  Ready to use directly with OpenAI's fine-tuning API.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### API Export

Retrieve dataset contents programmatically:

```typescript
// Query dataset contents
const response = await fetch(`https://api.helicone.ai/v1/helicone-dataset/${datasetId}/query`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    limit: 100,
    offset: 0
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
```

## Use Cases

### Replace Expensive Models with Fine-Tuned Alternatives

The most common use case - using your expensive model logs to train cheaper, faster models:

<Steps>
<Step title="Log high-quality outputs">
  Start logging successful requests from o3, Claude 4.1 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or other premium models that represent your ideal outputs
</Step>

<Step title="Build task-specific datasets">
  Create separate datasets for different tasks (e.g., "customer support", "code generation", "data extraction")
</Step>

<Step title="Curate for consistency">
  Review examples to ensure responses follow the same format, style, and quality standards
</Step>

<Step title="Fine-tune smaller models">
  Export JSONL and fine-tune o3-mini, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, or other models that are 10-50x cheaper
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate with production data">
  Continue collecting examples from your fine-tuned model to improve it over time
</Step>
</Steps>

### Task-Specific Evaluation Sets

Build evaluation datasets to test model performance:

```typescript
// Create eval sets for different capabilities
const datasets = {
  reasoning: 'Complex multi-step problems with verified solutions',
  extraction: 'Structured data extraction with known correct outputs',
  creativity: 'Creative writing with human-rated quality scores',
  edge_cases: 'Unusual inputs that often cause failures'
};
```

Use these to:
- Compare model versions before deploying
- Test prompt changes against consistent examples
- Identify model weaknesses and blind spots

### Continuous Improvement Pipeline

<Frame caption="Use scores and user feedback to identify your best examples">
  <img 
    src="/images/datasets/scores.webp" 
    alt="Filtering requests by scores to identify best examples for datasets"
  />
</Frame>

Build a data flywheel for model improvement:

1. **Tag requests** with custom properties for easy filtering
2. **Score outputs** based on user feedback or automated metrics
3. **Auto-collect winners** into datasets when they meet quality thresholds
4. **Regular retraining** with newly curated examples
5. **A/B test** new models against production traffic

<Note>
Start small - even 50-100 high-quality examples can significantly improve performance on specific tasks. Focus on one narrow use case first rather than trying to fine-tune a general-purpose model.
</Note>
