<Info>
  **Who can use this feature**: Anyone on any
  [plan](https://www.helicone.ai/pricing). However, the maximum number of caches
  you can store within a bucket is `20`. If you need to store more, you will
  need to upgrade to an enterprise plan.
</Info>

## Introduction

Caching, by temporarily storing data closer to the user at the edge, can significantly speed up access time and enhance your application performance.

Helicone uses [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) to temporarily store data closer to the user to ensure low latency, resulting in faster responses and an efficient app development process.

## Why Cache

- Faster response for commonly asked questions, resulting in better experience for your users.
- Lower latency and reduce the load on backend resources by pre-computing results or frequently accessed data, so you can develop your app more efficiently.
- Save money while testing your app by making fewer calls to model providers such as OpenAI.
- Determine the most common requests with your application and visualize on a dashboard.

## Quick Start

To get started, set `Helicone-Cache-Enabled` to true in the headers, or use the Python or NPM packages to turn it on via parameters.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Curl
curl https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Helicone-Cache-Enabled: true' \ # add this header and set to true
  -d '{
    "model": "text-davinci-003",
    "prompt": "How do I enable caching?",
}'
```

```python Python w/Package
response = openai.Completion.create(
	model="text-davinci-003",
	prompt="How do I cache with helicone?",
	cache=True,  # set cache to true
)
```

```python Python w/o Package
openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

openai.Completion.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="How do I cache with helicone?",
    headers={
      "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", # add this header and set to true
    }
)
```

```ts Node.js (w/ package)
import { HeliconeProxyConfiguration as Configuration } from "./core/HeliconeProxyConfiguration";
import { HeliconeProxyOpenAIApi as OpenAIApi } from "./proxy_logger/HeliconeProxyOpenAIApi";
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  heliconeMeta: {
    // ... other meta data
    cache: true, // set cache to true
  },
});

const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

```ts Node.js (w/o package)
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  basePath: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", // add this header and set to true
  },
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

### Cache Parameters

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Helicone-Cache-Enabled` (required)         | Set to `true` to enable storing and loading from your cache.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Cache-Control` (optional)                  | Configure cache limit as a `string` based on the [Cloudflare Cache Directive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/cache-control#cache-control-directives). Currently we only support `max-age`, but we will be adding more configuration options soon. I.e. 1 hour is `max-age=3600`. |
| `Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size` (optional) | Configure your Cache Bucket size as a `number`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Helicone-Cache-Seed` (optional)            | Define a separate cache state as a `string` to generate predictable results, i.e. `user-123`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

<Info>
  Header values have to be strings. For example,
  `"Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "10"`.{" "}
</Info>

### Changing Cache Limit

The default cache limit is 7 days. To change the limit, add the `Cache-Control` header to your request.

**Example**: Setting the cache limit to 30 days, aka `2592000 seconds`

```tsx
"Cache-Control": "max-age=2592000"
```

<Note>The max cache limit is 365 days, or `max-age=31536000`. </Note>

### Configuring Bucket Size

Simply add `Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size` with some number to choose how large you want your bucket size to be.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

openai.Completion.create(
model="text-davinci-003",
prompt="Say this is a test",
headers={
"Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {HELICONE_API_KEY}",
"Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", # mandatory
"Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3", # set cache bucket size to 3
}
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  basePath: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true", // mandatory
    "Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3", // set cache bucket size to 3
  },
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

</CodeGroup>

**Example**: A bucket size of 3

```
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "42"
# Cache Miss
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "47"
# Cache Miss
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "17"
# Cache Miss

openai.completion("give me a random number") -> This will randomly choose 42 | 47 | 17
# Cache Hit
```

<Note>
  The max number of caches you can store is `20` within a bucket, if you want
  more you will need to upgrade to an enterprise
  [plan](https://www.helicone.ai/pricing).
</Note>

### Adding Cache Seed

When you make a request to Helicone with the same seed, you will receive the same cached response for the same query. This feature allows for predictable results, which can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to have a consistent cache across multiple requests.

To set a cache seed, add a header called `Helicone-Cache-Seed` with a string value for the seed.

```tsx
  "Helicone-Cache-Seed": "user-123"
```

**Example**: Making the same request with 2 different seeds

By making a request with a Cache Seed `user-123` and query "give me a random number", you will always receive the same response (e.g., "42"), as long as the cache conditions remain unchanged. Now change the Cache Seed to `user-456` while making the same query will yield a different result (e.g., "17"), demonstrating how **different seeds can maintain separate cache states**.

```
# Bucket size 1

# Cache Seed "user-123"
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "42"
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "42"

# Cache Seed "user-456"
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "17"

# Cache Seed "user-123"
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "42"

# Cache Seed "user-456"
openai.completion("give me a random number") -> "17"
```

<Tip>
  {" "}
  If you don't like one of generated response stored in cache, you can update your
  seed to a different value as a way to clear your cache.
</Tip>

### Extracting Cache Response Headers

When cache is enabled, you can capture the cache status from the headers of the response, such as a `cache hit / miss` and the `cache bucket index` of the response returned.

```ts
helicone-cache:	"HIT" | "MISS" // indicates whether the response was cached.
helicone-cache-bucket-idx: number // indicates the cache bucket index used.
```

**Example**: Extracting headers from python with OpenAI

```python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer <API_KEY>",
    }
)

# 1. add `.with_raw_response` here
chat_completion_raw = client.chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello world!"}
    ],
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true" # make sure cache is enabled
        "Cache-Control": "max-age = 2592000", # change cache limit (optional)
        "Helicone-Cache-Bucket-Max-Size": "3", # configure cache bucket size (optional)
        "Helicone-Cache-Seed": "1", # add cache seed (optional)
    },
)

# This is the original parsed response as expected...
chat_completion = chat_completion_raw.parse()

# 2. get header response
cache_hit = chat_completion_raw.http_response.headers.get(
    'Helicone-Cache')

print(cache_hit) # will print "HIT" or "MISS"

```
