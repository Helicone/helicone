### What are Custom Properties?

Custom Properties allow you to add any additional information to your requests, such as:

- The **session,** **conversation**, or **app** id
- The **prompt chain** by adding a common value to group of requests
- **Application** or **user** metadata making the request

### Use Custom Properties to

- Get the the total cost or latency for a group of requests in a prompt chain
- Get the "unit economics" of your application, such as the average cost of a conversation or session
- Slice and dice your requests and metrics by any custom property

### Adding Custom Properties

Custom properties are added with headers to your OpenAI requests. For each header,

- The Key is `Helicone-Property-{Name}` with your property name in Name
- The Value is the string value for the property in the request.

  -H 'Helicone-Property-Session: "24"' \
  -H 'Helicone-Property-Conversation: "support_issue_2"' \
  -H 'Helicone-Property-App: "mobile"'
