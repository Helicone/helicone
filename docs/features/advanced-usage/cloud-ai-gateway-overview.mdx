<Warning>
  **This cloud AI Gateway is being deprecated.** While it remains available for
  existing users, we are no longer adding new features or major updates to this
  version.
</Warning>

## Migration Path

We're building a **new cloud-hosted AI Gateway** based on our improved [self-hosted AI Gateway](/ai-gateway/introduction). The new version offers:

- **Better performance** with Rust-based architecture
- **More providers** with 100+ LLM models supported
- **Advanced load balancing** with intelligent routing
- **Enhanced caching** for cost optimization
- **Improved reliability** with automatic failover

**Timeline:**

- **Current**: Legacy cloud gateway remains available
- **Coming Soon**: New cloud gateway based on self-hosted version
- **Future**: Gradual migration path for existing users

## Legacy Cloud AI Gateway Features

While you're using the current cloud gateway, here's the complete documentation for all available features:
