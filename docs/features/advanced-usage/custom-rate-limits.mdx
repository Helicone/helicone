## Introduction

Rate limits are an important feature that allows you to control the number of requests made with your API key within a specific time window. For example, you can limit users to `1000 requests per day` or `60 requests per minute`. By implementing rate limits, you can prevent abuse while protecting your resources from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic.

## Why Rate Limit

- **Prevent abuse of the API:** Limit the total requests a user can make in a given period to control cost.
- **Protect resources from excessive traffic:** Maintain availability for all users.
- **Control operational cost:** Limit the total number of requests sent and total cost.
- **Comply with third-party API usage policies:** Each model provider has their own rate limit for your key. Helicone's rate limit is bounded by your provider's policy.

## How Rate Limits Works

To set up rate limiting, simply add the `Helicone-RateLimit-Policy` header in your request. This will rate limit all requests made with the specified API key.

The header follows this format:

```tsx
"Helicone-RateLimit-Policy": "[quota];w=[time_window];u=[unit];s=[segment]"
```

### Rate Limit Parameters

| Parameter                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quota` (required)       | The maximum number of requests allowed within the specified time window.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `time_window` (required) | The unit is **seconds**. For example, you would use `w=86400` (60 _ 60 _ 24 = 86400) to set the time window for a single day. The minimum is `60` seconds.                                                                                               |
| `unit` (optional)        | Must be `request` or `cents`. If left blank, unit is set to `request` by default.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `segment` (optional)     | Must be `user` or a custom property. If left blank, segment is set to global by default. We'll explain the difference in the [Filtering By Segments](https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-rate-limits#filtering-by-segments) section. |

**Example:** A policy that allows 10 cents of requests per 1000 seconds per user.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Curl
curl https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -H 'Helicone-Property-IP: 111.1.1.1' \
  -H 'Helicone-User-Id: user-123' \
  -H 'Helicone-RateLimit-Policy: 10;w=1000;u=cents;s=user' \
  -d '{
    "model": "text-davinci-003",
    "prompt": "How do I enable custom rate limit policies?",
}'
```

```python Python
openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

client.chat.completions.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="How do I set custom rate limits?",
    extra_headers={
      "Helicone-Property-IP": "111.1.1.1",
      "Helicone-RateLimit-Policy": "10;w=1000;u=cents;s=user", # add this header and set the header value
    }
)
```

```js Node.js
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  basePath: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Property-IP": "111.1.1.1",
    "Helicone-RateLimit-Policy": "10;w=1000;u=cents;s=user", // add this header and set the header value
  },
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

</CodeGroup>
<Tip>
  Fun fact: this policy format is an [IETF standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers/)
  for specifying rate limits! Except for the segment field, that's a Helicone special
  twist 🍬
</Tip>

### Filtering By Segments

The `s=[segment]` parameter is used to specify the scope in which you want to apply rate limits to all requests made with an API key. You can apply rate limits **globally**, **by users**, or **by a custom property**.

- **Global rate limiting:** leave the segment field empty (i.e. `1000;w=60`).
- **Rate limiting by user:** set the segment field to "user" (i.e. `1000;w=60;s=user`).
  - In addition, the user ID must be included as a parameter in the request or in the helicone-user-id header (i.e. `"Helicone-User-Id": "username"`).
  - See [User Metrics](/features/advanced-usage/user-metrics) for more details.
- **Rate limiting by a custom property:** set the segment field to the desired property name (i.e. `1000;w=60;s=[property_name]`).
  - In addition, include a corresponding header in the request (i.e. `"Helicone-Property-{property_name}": "some label"`).
  - See [Custom Properties](/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties) for more details.

**Examples:** Here is a list of example policies to use for the header `Helicone-RateLimit-Policy`:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting Globally" icon="earth-americas">
  - Quota: 10k requests
  - Time window: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
  - Segment: global (default)

**Header policy value:** `10000;w=3600`

{" "}

<Info>
  Notice the `s=[segment]` parameter is ignored since the default is
  global.{" "}
</Info>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting By User" icon="user">
    - Quota: 500k requests
    - Time window: 1 day (86400 seconds)
    - Segment: user

    **Header policy value:** `500000;w=86400;s=user`


    <Warning>Don't forget to add [User Metrics](/features/advanced-sage/user-metrics). </Warning>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting By Custom Property" icon="tag">
    - Quota: 300 requests
    - Time window: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
    - Segment: organization (custom property)

    **Header policy value:** `300;w=1800;s=organization`

    <Warning>Don't forget to set the custom property for organization in the request, see [Custom Properties](/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties). </Warning>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Extracting Rate Limit Response Headers

Extracting the headers allows you to test your rate limit policy in a local environment before deploying to production.

If your rate limit policy is **active**, the following headers will be returned:

```bash
Helicone-RateLimit-Limit: "number" // the request/cost quota allowed in the time window.
Helicone-RateLimit-Policy: "[quota];w=[time_window];u=[unit];s=[segment]" // the active rate limit policy.
Helicone-RateLimit-Remaining: "number" // the remaining quota in the time window.
```

- `Helicone-RateLimit-Limit`: The quota for the number of requests allowed in the time window.
- `Helicone-RateLimit-Policy`: The active rate limit policy.
- `Helicone-RateLimit-Remaining`: The remaining quota in the current window.

<Note>
  If a request is rate-limited, a 429 rate limit error will be returned.
</Note>

**Example:** Extracting headers from python with OpenAI

```python
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
    base_url="https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer <HELICONE_API_KEY>",
    }
)

# 1. add `.with_raw_response` here
chat_completion_raw = client.chat.completions.with_raw_response.create(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello world!"}
    ],
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-RateLimit-Policy": "10000;w=3600" # add rate limit policy here
    },
)

# This is the original parsed response as expected...
chat_completion = chat_completion_raw.parse()

# 2. get header response
rate_limit = chat_completion_raw.http_response.headers.get(
    'Helicone-RateLimit')

print(rate_limit) # will print the Rate Limit header responses

```

## Latency Considerations

Using rate limits adds a small amount of latency to your requests. This feature is deployed with [Cloudflare’s key-value data store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/reference/how-kv-works/), which is a low-latency service that stores data in a small number of centralized data centers and caches that data in Cloudflare’s data centers after access. The latency add-on is minimal compared to multi-second OpenAI requests.

## Coming Soon

Soon, we will support rate limiting by `tokens` and `cost`. Additionally, you will be able to see how close your requests, users, and properties are to hitting their rate limits in the web UI.
