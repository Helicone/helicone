<Info>
  **Who can use this feature**: Anyone on [Pro or
  Enterprise](https://www.helicone.ai/pricing) plan.
</Info>

Fine-tuning allows you to reduce your costs and improve your applications performance - all using the data already inside of Helicone. Read more about
it here: [OpenAI's fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a dataset">
    Navigate to the request page and use filters to get your desired dataset

    </Frame>

    Press `Create Dataset` and name it

    </Frame>
    <Tip>You need at least 10 requests within a dataset to fine-tune.</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a fine-tuning job">
    Navigate to the fine-tune page and creete a new fine-tuning job.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replace your model name">
    Once your fine-tuning job is completed, all you have to do is replace the model name and you can start using the new fine-tuned model!
