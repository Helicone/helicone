Fine-tuning allows you to reduce your costs and improve your applications performance - all using the data already inside of Helicone. Read more about
it here: [OpenAI's fine-tuning guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a dataset">
    Navigate to the request page and use filters to get your desired dataset
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/features/fine-tuning/filters.png" alt="Filtering requests on the request page to create a dataset in Helicone."/>
    </Frame>

    Press `Create Dataset` and name it
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/features/fine-tuning/create-dataset.png" alt ="Creating and name your dataset in Helicone." width={400} />
    </Frame>
    <Tip>You need at least 10 requests within a dataset to fine-tune.</Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a fine-tuning job">
    Navigate to the fine-tune page and creete a new fine-tuning job.
    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/features/fine-tuning/fine-tune-job.png" alt="Starting a fine-tuning job in Helicone." width={400} />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replace your model name">
    Once your fine-tuning job is completed, all you have to do is replace the model name and you can start using the new fine-tuned model!
