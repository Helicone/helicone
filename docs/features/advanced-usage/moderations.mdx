## Introduction

By integrating with OpenAI's moderation endpoint, Helicone helps you check whether the user message is potentially harmful.

### Why Moderations

- Identifying harmful requests and take action, for example, by filtering it.
- Ensuring any inappropriate or harmful content in user messages is flagged and prevented from being processed.
- Maintaining the safety of the interactions with your application.

## Getting Started

To enable moderation, set `Helicone-Moderations-Enabled` to `true`.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Curl
curl https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Helicone-Auth: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Helicone-Moderations-Enabled: true' \ # Add this header and set to true
  -d '{
    "model": "text-davinci-003",
    "prompt": "How do I enable moderations?",
}'
```

```python Python
openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

client.chat.completions.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="How do I enable moderations?",
    extra_headers={
      "Helicone-Moderations-Enabled": "true", # Add this header and set to true
    }
)
```

```js Node
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  basePath: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
    "Helicone-Moderations-Enabled": "true", // Add this header and set to true
  },
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The moderation call to the OpenAI endpoint will utilize your provided OpenAI
  API key.
</Note>

<Accordion title="A Deep-Dive of the Moderation Process">
  1. **Activation:** When `Helicone-Moderations-Enabled` is true and the provider is OpenAI, the user's latest message is prepared for moderation before any chat completion request.
  2. **Moderation Check:** Our proxy sends the message to the OpenAI Moderation endpoint to assess its content.
  3. **Flag Evaluation:** If the moderation endpoint flags the message as inappropriate or harmful, an error response is generated.

</Accordion>

### Error Repsonse

If the message is flagged, the response will have a `400 status code`. **It's crucial to handle this response appropriately.**

If the message is not flagged, the proxy forwards it to the chat completion endpoint, and the process continues as normal.

Here's an example of the error response when flagged:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PROMPT_FLAGGED_FOR_MODERATION",
    "message": "The given prompt was flagged by the OpenAI Moderation endpoint.",
    "details": "See your Helicone request page for more info: https://www.helicone.ai/requests?[REQUEST_ID]"
  }
}
```
