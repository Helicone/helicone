## Enabling Moderation

Add `Helicone-Moderations-Enabled: true` to your request headers to activate OpenAI moderation.

## Moderation Process and How It Works

1. **Activation:** When `Helicone-Moderations-Enabled` is true and the provider is OpenAI, the user's latest message is prepared for moderation before any chat completion request.
2. **Moderation Check:** Our proxy sends the message to the OpenAI Moderation endpoint to assess its content.

3. **Flag Evaluation:** If the moderation endpoint flags the message as inappropriate or harmful, an error response is generated:

   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": {
       "code": "PROMPT_FLAGGED_FOR_MODERATION",
       "message": "The given prompt was flagged by the OpenAI Moderation endpoint.",
       "details": "See your Helicone request page for more info: https://www.helicone.ai/requests?[REQUEST_ID]"
     }
   }
   ```

If the message is flagged, the response will have a 400 status code. **It's crucial to handle this response appropriately.**

If the message is not flagged, the proxy forwards it to the chat completion endpoint, and the process continues as normal.

### Using Your API Key

The moderation call to the OpenAI endpoint will utilize your provided OpenAI API key.

## Future Enhancements

We're continually expanding our moderation features. Upcoming updates include:
