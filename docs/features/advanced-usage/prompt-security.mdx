## Enabling Prompt Security

Add `Helicone-Prompt-Security-Enabled: true` to your request headers.

## How It Works

- **OpenAI Chat Support:** Exclusively for OpenAI chat completions.
- **Analysis:** Only the latest user message is checked for threats.
- **Security Checks:** Requests are analyzed for injection threats using [Prompt Armor](https://promptarmor.com).
- **Response on Threat Detection:** Requests with detected threats are rejected.
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": {
      "code": "PROMPT_THREAT_DETECTED",
      "message": "Prompt threat detected. Your request cannot be processed.",
      "details": "See your Helicone request page for more info."
    }
  }
  ```
- **Latency:** Security checks add minimal latency, typically under one second.
- **Normal Requests:** Clean requests are forwarded without delay.

## Monitoring

Detected threats and details are accessible on your Helicone request page for review.
