### Why User Metrics

- Gain detailed insights into individual user activity
- Track per-user request volumes, costs, and usage patterns
- Optimize resource allocation based on user-specific trends
- Improve performance and detect potential abuse

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add User ID

There are two ways to specify users in your requests:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Option 1: Using OpenAI API">
    The OpenAI API has an optional [`user` parameter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-user), where you can specify an end-user to help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Option 2: Sending the User ID via Helicone">
    Alternatively, you can send a prompt with the header `Helicone-User-Id` to include the user ID. The value must be a _string_, for example, use an `email` or the `user ID`.
      <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Curl
      curl https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/completions \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Helicone-Auth: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
        -H 'Helicone-User-Id: "alicebob@gmail.com"' # Add this header
      ```

      ```python Python
      openai.api_base = "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1"

      openai.Completion.create(
          model="text-davinci-003",
          prompt="How do I log users?",
          headers={
              "Helicone-User-Id": "alicebob@gmail.com" # Add this header
          }
      )
      ```

      ```js Node.js
      import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";
      const configuration = new Configuration({
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
        basePath: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
        defaultHeaders: {
            Helicone-User-Id: "alicebob@gmail.com", // Add this header
        },
      });
      const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
      ```

      </CodeGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: View Detailed Metrics

Once set up correctly, you will be able to see detailed user metrics under the `Users` tab.
