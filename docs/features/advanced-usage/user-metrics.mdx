## User Identification & Tracking

### Setting User IDs
Track users across sessions and requests:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o/openai",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
  headers: {
    "Helicone-User-Id": "user-12345"
  }
});
```

```python Python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o/openai",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    extra_headers={
        "Helicone-User-Id": "user-12345"
    }
)
```

```bash cURL
curl https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai/ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HELICONE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Helicone-User-Id: user-12345" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o/openai", "messages": [...]}'
```
</CodeGroup>

### User Properties
Enrich user data with additional context:

```typescript
// Add user segmentation data
{
  headers: {
    "Helicone-User-Id": "user-12345",
    "Helicone-Property-UserTier": "premium",
    "Helicone-Property-UserType": "business",
    "Helicone-Property-SignupDate": "2024-01-15",
    "Helicone-Property-Industry": "healthcare"
  }
}
```

## User Behavior Analytics

### Usage Patterns

    "peak_usage_hours": [9, 14, 16],
    "session_length_avg": "12 minutes",
    "favorite_features": ["chat", "summary", "analysis"],
    "model_preferences": ["gpt-4o/openai", "claude-3.5-sonnet-v2/anthropic"]
  }
}
```

### Engagement Metrics
Track how engaged users are with your AI features:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Session Metrics">
    - **Session duration** - Time spent in conversations
    - **Messages per session** - Conversation depth
    - **Return sessions** - Users coming back within 24h
    - **Session completion rate** - Conversations finished vs abandoned
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Request Patterns">
    - **Request frequency** - How often users make requests
    - **Request complexity** - Token length and reasoning difficulty
    - **Feature usage** - Which AI features are most popular

    - **Feedback scores** - Explicit user ratings
    - **Completion rate** - Requests that achieve user goals
    - **Follow-up questions** - Indicator of engagement
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## User Segmentation

### Automatic Segmentation
Helicone automatically groups users based on behavior:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Power Users" icon="zap">
  High request volume, long sessions
  Top 10% of users by usage
</Card>
<Card title="Casual Users" icon="coffee">
  Moderate usage, shorter sessions
  Majority of user base
</Card>
<Card title="New Users" icon="user-plus">
  Recent signups, learning patterns
  First 30 days of usage
</Card>
<Card title="At-Risk Users" icon="alert-triangle">
  Declining usage, potential churn
  Require retention efforts
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Custom Segmentation
Create segments based on your business logic:

```typescript
// Business tier segmentation
{
  "free_tier": {
    "monthly_request_limit": 1000,
    "features": ["basic_chat"],
    "support_level": "community"
  },
  "pro_tier": {
    "monthly_request_limit": 10000,
    "features": ["chat", "analysis", "summaries"],
    "support_level": "email"
  },
  "enterprise_tier": {

- **Communication style** - Formal vs casual interaction patterns
- **Feature usage** - Which features each user finds valuable
- **Session timing** - When users are most active

### Adaptive Experiences
Use metrics to personalize experiences:

```typescript
// Personalized model selection based on user history
const getUserPreferredModel = (userId: string) => {
  const userMetrics = getUserMetrics(userId);
  
  if (userMetrics.prefers_speed) {
    return "gpt-4o-mini/openai,gemini-flash/google";
  }
  
  if (userMetrics.prefers_quality) {
    return "claude-3.5-sonnet-v2/anthropic,gpt-4o/openai";
  }
  
  return "gpt-4o-mini/openai,claude-3.5-haiku/anthropic";
};
```

## Comparative Analytics

### User Benchmarking
Compare user performance against benchmarks:

- **Usage vs peers** - How users compare to similar cohorts
- **Efficiency metrics** - Requests per goal achieved
- **Feature adoption** - Adoption rate vs typical users
- **Satisfaction vs average** - Experience quality comparison

### A/B Testing
Test improvements with user metrics:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Feature Test
// A/B test new feature with user segments
const experimentVariant = getUserExperiment(userId, 'new_chat_ui');

if (experimentVariant === 'variant_a') {
  // Show improved chat interface
  return <NewChatUI />;
} else {
  // Show current interface  
  return <CurrentChatUI />;
}
```

```typescript Model Test
// Test model preference by user segment
const modelTest = getUserExperiment(userId, 'model_selection');

const model = modelTest === 'claude_first' 
  ? "claude-3.5-sonnet-v2/anthropic,gpt-4o/openai"
  : "gpt-4o/openai,claude-3.5-sonnet-v2/anthropic";

await client.chat.completions.create({ model, messages });
