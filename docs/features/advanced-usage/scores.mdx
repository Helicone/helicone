      function calculateScore(data: HeliconeRequest): Record<string, number> {
        if (data.response_body) {
          return {
            vocabulary_diversity: calculateVocabularyDiversity(data.response_body),
            // Add more scores here
          };

      }
      ```

## Local Testing

If you want to test your scoring logic locally you'll need to use wrangler secrets to add appropriate value for `HELICONE_AUTH`.

```sh
$ wrangler secret put HELICONE_AUTH
```

And run Scoring Webhook locally:

```sh
$ wrangler deploy
```
