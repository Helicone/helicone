### Introducing Vault

Vault is designed to securely store provider API keys (from OpenAI and future providers) and offers a seamless integration with Helicone proxy keys for enhanced management.

### How does Vault work?

1. **Add a Provider Key**: Start by adding your provider API key. For instance, if you're using OpenAI, you'd add your OpenAI key. Assign a unique name to this provider key for easy identification.
2. **Generate a Proxy Key**: Create a proxy key and give it a name. Helicone will then generate a unique proxy key for you. This proxy key acts as an authorization Bearer token when making requests.

### Benefits of Using Vault

- **Simplified Key Management**: Send just one key to Helicone, eliminating the need to manage both a Helicone auth and an OpenAI key.
- **Enhanced Security**: Distribute Helicone keys, ensuring users interact through our Helicone proxy.
- **Prevent Bypass**: No need to distribute OpenAI keys directly, which could let users bypass our valuable logging and monitoring.

### Important Notes

- **Multiple Proxy Keys**: It's possible to have several proxy keys mapped to one provider key. This flexibility can be especially useful for large teams or segmented projects.
- **Safekeeping**: Ensure you copy and safely store the generated proxy key right away. It uses one-way hashing, meaning if you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
- **Performance**: There's a minor increase in latency on requests since Helicone validates the proxy key auth before retrieving the actual provider key. This step ensures enhanced security and proper routing.
