<Info>**Who can use this feature**: Anyone on Helicone's [Growth, Enterprise](https://www.helicone.ai/pricing) and our old Pro plan has access to Key Vault. If you are on a Free plan, upgrade to Growth or [contact us](https://www.helicone.ai/contact). </Info>


## Introduction

Vault is designed to securely store provider API keys (from OpenAI and future providers). It offers a seamless integration with Helicone proxy keys for enhanced management.

### Why Key Vault

- **Simplified Key Management**: Send just one key to Helicone, eliminating the need to manage both a Helicone auth and an OpenAI key.
- **Enhanced Security**: Distribute Helicone keys, ensuring users interact through our Helicone proxy.
- **Prevent Bypass**: No need to distribute OpenAI keys directly, which could let users bypass our valuable logging and monitoring.


## Quick Start

### Step 1: Store your Provider Keys 
1. Go to the `Developer` tab > `Vault` > `Add Provider Key`. 
2. Enter your provider key and assign a **unique** name to it for easy identification. 
3. Click `Create Provider Key`.

<Note>Currently, Helicone helps you store OpenAI Provider Key. In the future, we plan to expand to include other providers. </Note>

  At Helicone, we use transparent column encryption with the `XChaCha20 cryptographic algorithm` and `nonce support` to securely encrypt all keys at rest, ensuring an extra layer of protection.

### Step 2: Generate Proxy Keys for Your Team  
1. On the same `Vault` page, click on `Create Proxy Key`. 
2. Create a name, then select your provider key from the dropdown.
3. Click `Create Proxy Key`.

</Frame>

Helicone will then generate a unique proxy key for you. This proxy key acts as an authorization Bearer token when making requests.

<Tip>**It's possible to have several proxy keys mapped to one provider key.** This flexibility can be especially useful for large teams or segmented projects.</Tip>


### Step 3: Store the Proxy Key Safely 

Copy the key and store it somewhere safe. You can now share this key with another team member.

</Frame>

<Warning>**Ensure you copy and safely store the generated proxy key right away.** It uses one-way hashing, meaning if you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.</Warning>


## Important Notes

- **Other Keys:** Currently, you can store OpenAI Provider Keys safely in Helicone. We plan to expand to include future providers.
- **Multiple Proxy Keys**: It's possible to have several proxy keys mapped to one provider key. This flexibility can be especially useful for large teams or segmented projects.
- **Safekeeping**: Ensure you copy and safely store the generated proxy key right away. It uses one-way hashing, meaning if you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
- **Performance**: There's a minor increase in latency on requests since Helicone validates the proxy key auth before retrieving the actual provider key. This step ensures enhanced security and proper routing.
