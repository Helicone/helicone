## Introduction

Vault is designed to securely store provider API keys (from OpenAI and future providers). It offers a seamless integration with Helicone proxy keys for enhanced management.

### Why Key Vault

- **Simplified Key Management**: Send just one key to Helicone, eliminating the need to manage both a Helicone auth and an OpenAI key.
- **Enhanced Security**: Distribute Helicone keys, ensuring users interact through our Helicone proxy.
- **Prevent Bypass**: No need to distribute OpenAI keys directly, which could let users bypass our valuable logging and monitoring.
- **Flexible Resource Allocation**:
  - **For Hackathons:** Easily distribute AI credits to participants and implement rate limiting.
  - **For Companies:** Allocate and control AI usage credits for employees or departments.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Store your Provider Keys

1. Go to the `Developer` tab > `Vault` > `Add Provider Key`.
2. Enter your provider key and assign a **unique** name to it for easy identification.
3. Click `Create Provider Key`.

<Note>
  Currently, Helicone helps you store OpenAI Provider Key. In the future, we
  plan to expand to include other providers.{" "}
</Note>

<Accordion title="How we encrypt your Provider Key securely?">
  At Helicone, we use transparent column encryption with the `XChaCha20
  cryptographic algorithm` and `nonce support` to securely encrypt all keys at
  rest, ensuring an extra layer of protection.
</Accordion>

### Step 2: Generate Proxy Keys for Your Team

1. On the same `Vault` page, click on `Create Proxy Key`.
2. Create a name, then select your provider key from the dropdown.
3. Click `Create Proxy Key`.

</Frame>

Helicone will then generate a unique proxy key for you. This proxy key acts as an authorization Bearer token when making requests.

<Tip>
  **It's possible to have several proxy keys mapped to one provider key.** This
  flexibility can be especially useful for large teams or segmented projects.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Store the Proxy Key Safely

Copy the key and store it somewhere safe. You can now share this key with another team member.

</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Ensure you copy and safely store the generated proxy key right away.** It
  uses one-way hashing, meaning if you lose it, you'll need to generate a new
  one.
</Warning>

## Important Notes

- **Other Keys:** Currently, you can store OpenAI Provider Keys safely in Helicone. We plan to expand to include future providers.
- **Multiple Proxy Keys**: It's possible to have several proxy keys mapped to one provider key. This flexibility can be especially useful for large teams or segmented projects.
- **Safekeeping**: Ensure you copy and safely store the generated proxy key right away. It uses one-way hashing, meaning if you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
- **Performance**: There's a minor increase in latency on requests since Helicone validates the proxy key auth before retrieving the actual provider key. This step ensures enhanced security and proper routing.
