## Introduction

Do you have a product that charges customers based on LLM usage?

Whether you are hosting your own model or using one of the top model providers, you and your team can easily manage your customers and their usage with Helicone's Customer Portal.

<Accordion title="Get a deep dive of how Customer Portal works">

Helicone's Customer Portal is a proxy that sits between your model and your customers.

- Your customer uses your provider key (that Helicone securely encrypted) to access
your LLM application. - Helicone logs all requests and extracts the data in order
to bring customer insights to you. - Getting access to your customer's usage allows
you to set up billing accordingly.{" "}

<Note>
  **Proxy is not required for this feature.** If you prefer not to use a proxy,

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Adding your customers

Go to `Customer Portal` from your left nav, and click `Add Customer`. Set a rate limit for your customer, then add a provider key.

<Check>
  Don't worry, your customers will create their own proxy key that maps to your
  provider key, and will not be able to see the exact key.{" "}
</Check>
