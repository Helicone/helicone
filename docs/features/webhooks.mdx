## Top use cases

- **Scoring**: [Score requests based on custom logic](/features/advanced-usage/scores).
- **Data ETL**: Moving data from one system to another.
- **Automations** / Alerts: Trigger actions automatically, such as sending a Slack notification or triggering a webhook to an external tool.

## Setting up webhooks

Head over to the [webhooks page](https://us.helicone.ai/webhooks) to set up a webhook.

<Frame caption="Webhooks page">
  <img src="/images/webhooks/ngrok-example.png" alt="Ngrok example" />
</Frame>

Add the webhook URL and select the events you want to trigger on.

You will want to copy the HMAC key and add it to your webhook environment to validate the signature of the webhook request.

## Configure your webhook route

<Note>
  We recommend for startups to use [Cloudflare
  workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or [Vercel edge
  functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) for webhooks,
  they are simple to setup and scale very well.

We have a prebuilt [Cloudflare worker](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/tree/main/examples/worker-helicone-scores) that you can use as a starting point.

</Note>

The webhook endpoint is a POST route that accepts the following JSON body:

### POST /webhook

The body of the request will contain the following fields:

- `request_id`: The request ID of the request that triggered the webhook.
- `request_body`: The body of the request that triggered the webhook.
- `response_body`: The body of the response that triggered the webhook.

### Example - NextJS

```tsx
import crypto from "crypto";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { request_id, request_body, response_body } = req.body;

  // STEP 1: Validate the signature of the webhook request
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac("sha256", process.env.HELICONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify({ request_id, request_body, response_body }));
  const signature = hmac.digest("hex");
  if (signature !== req.headers["helicone-signature"]) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  // STEP 2: Do something with the webhook data
  console.log(request_id, request_body, response_body);
  // ...
  // EX: You can submit a score using our [Scoring API](/features/scoring)

  return res.status(200).json({ message: "Webhook received" });
}
```

## Webhook Configuration

When setting up a webhook, you can configure the following options:

1. **Destination URL**: The URL where webhook payloads will be sent.
2. **Sample Rate**: Control what percentage of requests trigger webhooks (0-100%).
3. **Property Filters**: Only send webhooks for requests with specific properties.
4. **Include Data**: Toggle whether to include additional data like costs and S3 links (enabled by default).

### Standard Webhook Payload

By default, webhooks send a minimal payload with just the request ID and truncated request/response bodies:

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid-string",
  "request_body": "request-body-string",
  "response_body": "response-body-string"
}
```

### Enhanced Webhook Payload

When the `includeData` option is enabled, webhooks include additional useful information:

```json
{
  "request_id": "uuid-string",
  "request_body": "request-body-string",
  "response_body": "response-body-string",
  "request_body_url": "https://s3-url-to-full-request-body",
  "response_body_url": "https://s3-url-to-full-response-body",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "provider": "openai",
  "metadata": {
    "cost": 0.0123,
    "promptTokens": 150,
    "completionTokens": 50,
    "totalTokens": 200,
    "latencyMs": 1200
  }
}
```

The enhanced payload provides:

- **S3 URLs**: Direct links to the full request and response bodies
- **Model Information**: The model and provider used
- **Cost Data**: Calculated cost based on token usage
- **Token Counts**: Prompt, completion, and total token counts
- **Latency**: Request-to-response time in milliseconds

This additional data makes it easier to track costs and analyze performance without making additional API calls.
