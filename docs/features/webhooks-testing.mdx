## How to test webhooks locally

The idea is that we are going to use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local machine so that Helicone can send events to your local server.

## Create your local worker server

Here is a simple python example using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/):

```bash
python3 -m pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Create a file called `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/")
async def webhook(request: Request):
    return {"message": "Webhook received"}
```

Run the server using:

```bash
python3 -m uvicorn server:app --reload --port 9393
```

you should see something like this...

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:9393 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [20505] using StatReload
INFO:     Started server process [20507]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

## Setting up ngrok

1. Install ngrok using the [official guide](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/setup/install).
2. Run `ngrok http <port>`, where `<port>` is the port that your local server is running on.

```bash
ngrok http 9393
```

You should see something like this...

```
Session Status                online
Account                       justin@helicone.ai (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.15.1
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       63ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://9742-103-249-231-120.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:9393
```

## Copy the ngrok URL

Add the URL outputed from `ngrok` to your webhook configuration in the Helicone webhooks page.

in our example it would be:
`https://9742-103-249-231-120.ngrok-free.app`

<Frame caption="Webhooks page">
  <img src="/images/webhooks/ngrok-example.png" alt="Ngrok example" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  For this testing example I added the property filter `environment` to equal to
  `dev` so that it only sends events to this webhook from our development
  environment.
</Note>

## Send a request through Helicone to receive the webhook

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://oai.helicone.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Helicone-Auth: Bearer $HELICONE_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Helicone-Property-environment: dev' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "Say Hello!"
        }
    ],
    "temperature": 1,
    "max_tokens": 10
}'
```

After sending the request you should see the webhook hit your local server.
