## Introduction

Helicone's prompt management provides a seamless way for users to track the prompts used in their generative AI applications. With Helicone, you can effortlessly monitor versions and inputs as they evolve.

</Frame>

### Why Prompts

Requests are now matched to a `helicone-prompt-id`, allowing you to:

- version and track iterations to your prompt over time, without losing any previous versions.
- maintain a dataset of inputs and outputs for each prompt version.


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To use Prompts, you must set up Helicone in proxy mode. Please ensure you use one of the methods in our [Starter Guide](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/quick-start#quick-start).

<Note>
  Not sure if proxy is for you? We created a guide to explain the difference
  between [Helicone Proxy vs Helicone Async
  integration](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/proxy-vs-async).
</Note>


### How Prompt Templates Work
As you modify your prompt in code, Helicone automatically tracks the new version and maintains a record of the old prompt. Additionally, a dataset of input/output keys is preserved for each version.

<Accordion title="Get a deep dive of the feature">

### For Typescript / Javascript users:

By prefixing your prompt with `hprompt` and enclosing your input variables in an additional `{}`, it allows Helicone to easily detect your prompt and inputs. We designed for minimum code change to keep it as easy as possible to use Prompts.

```tsx
const location = "space";
const character = "two brothers";
const promptInput = hprompt`
Compose a movie scene involving ${{ character }}, set in ${{ location }}
`;
```

### For other users:

Currently, we only support packages for TypeScript and JavaScript for easy integration. For other users, we are utilizing an adapted version of JSX to manage prompts and their input variables.

1. When you send over a prompt with the following syntax, we are able to extract the children text between the JSX element `helicone-prompt-input`, then place it back into the prompt to be sent to your LLM.

  ```tsx
  <helicone-prompt-input key="my_input_key">
    Input to your LLM
  </helicone-prompt-input>
  ```

  Only the following will be sent to your LLM:

  ```tsx
      Input to your LLM
  ```

<Note>
  It is crucial that each key has a unique identifier; otherwise, you will get
  the same variable replacing in multiple places.
</Note>

2. Then, all of the input variables are mapped to the key `my_input_key` as a dictionary in Helicone:

```json
{
  "my_input_key": "Input to your LLM"
}
```

</Accordion>

### Example

Let's say we have an app that generates a short story, where users are able to input their own `character`. For example, the prompt is “Write a story about a secret agent”, where the `character` is “a secret agent”.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Typescript / Javascript">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Import hprompt">
      ```tsx
      import { hprompt } from "@helicone/helicone";
      ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add `hprompt` and identify input variables">
      Using the backtick string formatter in JavaScript, add `hprompt` in front of your backtick to automatically format your text so that Helicone can determine where your variables are.

      Next, nest your inputted variable so that it is within another bracket `{}`, this is essentially
      making it so that we can determine the `input key` for Helicone.

      ```tsx
      content: hprompt`Write a story about ${{ character }}`,
      ```

        <Accordion title="Change input name">
          If you want to rename your input or have a custom input, you can change the key-value pair in the passed dictionary to the string formatter function. Like this:

          ```tsx
          content: hprompt`Write a story about ${{ "my_magical_input": character  }}`,
          ```
        </Accordion>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Assign an id to your prompt">
        Assign a `Helicone-Prompt-Id` header to your LLM request.

        Assigning an id allows us to associate your prompt with future versions of your prompt, and automatically manage versions on your behalf.

        Depending on the package you are using, you will need to add a header. For more information on adding headers to packages, please see [Header Directory](/helicone-headers/header-directory).

        ```tsx
        headers: {
          "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
        },
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    #### Here's what your code would look like:

    ``` tsx
    // 1. Add this line
    import { hprompt } from "@helicone/helicone";

    const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
      {
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            // 2: Add hprompt to any string, and nest any variable in additional brackets `{}`
            content: hprompt`Write a story about ${{ character }}`,
          },
        ],
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      },
      {
        // 3. Add Prompt Id Header
        headers: {
          "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "prompt_story",
        },
      }
    );
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Packageless (cURL)">
      Currently, we only support packages for TypeScript and JavaScript for easy integration. For other users, we recommend manually implementing input variables as follow:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Identify the input variable, and create a key name.">
      Given the below string, let's say `a secret agent` is our inputted variable. Let's name our key `character`.

      ```tsx
      Write a story about a secret agent
      ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add helicone-prompt-input tags">
      Add `<helicone-prompt-input key="<INPUT_ID>">` before your input variable, and `</helicone-prompt-input>` after, where `INPUT_ID` is your key name. In this example, `key=”character”`:

      ```tsx
      Write a story about <helicone-prompt-input key="character" >a secret agent</helicone-prompt-input>
      ```
      <Check> Don't worry, Helicone will remove these tags for you before the prompt is sent to your LLM.</Check>
      <Note>It is crucial that each key has a **unique identifier**; otherwise, the same variable will be replaced in multiple places. </Note>

      </Step>

      <Step title="Tag your prompt">

        In order to securely ensure that we know when and how to parse and categorize your prompt, please append the following header to your LLM request.

        ```tsx
        Helicone-Prompt-Id: you_prompt_id
        ```
        <Note>
        The id must not include any spaces or special characters. Underscores and dashes are acceptable.
        </Note>

      </Step>

      <Step title="Make a request">
        You just created a prompt template! Helicone will now keep track of all of your inputs for you. Rest assure that all of the helicone-prompt-input tags will removed before your prompt is sent to your LLM.
      </Step>

    </Steps>

    #### Here's what your code would look like:
    ```python
    openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      model="[DEPLOYMENT]",
      # Manually add starting and ending tags with before and after variables
      messages=[{"role": "User", "content": f'Write a story about <helicone-prompt-input key="character" >{character} </helicone-prompt-input>'}],
      headers={
        # Add Prompt Id header
        "Helicone-Prompt-Id": "[my_prompt_id]",
      }
    )
    ```

## Local Testing

Many times in development, you may want to test your prompt locally before deploying it to production and you don't want Helicone to track new prompt versions.

To do this, you can set the `Helicone-Prompt-Mode` header to `testing` in your LLM request. This will prevent Helicone from tracking new prompt versions.

```tsx
headers: {
  "Helicone-Prompt-Mode": "testing",
},
```
