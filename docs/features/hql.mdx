Helicone Query Language (HQL) lets you query your Helicone analytics data directly using SQL.

<Note>
HQL is currently available to selected workspaces. If you don’t see the HQL page in your dashboard, click “Request Access” from the HQL screen or contact support.
</Note>

## What you can query

- **request_created_at**: timestamp of the request
- **request_model**: model name used (e.g. `gpt-4o`)
- **status**: HTTP status code
- **user_id**: your application user identifier (if provided)
- **cost** / **provider_total_cost**: cost metrics
- **prompt_tokens**, **completion_tokens**, **total_tokens**: token usage
- **properties**: custom properties map (e.g. `properties['Helicone-Session-Id']`)

## Examples

### Top costly requests (last 7 days)

```sql
SELECT 
  request_created_at,
  request_model,
  response_body,
  provider_total_cost
FROM request_response_rmt
WHERE request_created_at > now() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
ORDER BY provider_total_cost DESC
LIMIT 100
```

### Error rate (last 24 hours)

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNTIf(status BETWEEN 400 AND 599) AS error_count,
  COUNT() AS total_requests,
  ROUND(error_count / total_requests, 4) AS error_rate
FROM request_response_rmt
WHERE request_created_at >= toDateTime64(now(), 3) - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
```

### Active users by day (last 14 days)

```sql
SELECT 
  toDate(request_created_at) AS day,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS dau
FROM request_response_rmt
WHERE request_created_at >= toDateTime64(now(), 3) - INTERVAL 14 DAY
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```

### Session analysis using custom properties

```sql
SELECT 
  properties['Helicone-Session-Id'] AS session_id,
  COUNT(*) AS requests,
  sum(cost) AS total_cost
FROM request_response_rmt
WHERE request_created_at >= toDateTime64(now(), 3) - INTERVAL 7 DAY
  AND properties['Helicone-Session-Id'] IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY session_id
ORDER BY total_cost DESC
LIMIT 100
```

### Cost by model (last 30 days)

```sql
SELECT 
  request_model,
  sum(cost) AS total_cost,
  COUNT() AS request_count
FROM request_response_rmt
WHERE request_created_at >= toDateTime64(now(), 3) - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY request_model
ORDER BY total_cost DESC
```

## How to use HQL

### In the Dashboard

1. Go to `HQL` in the sidebar
2. Browse tables and columns in the left panel
3. Write your SQL in the editor
4. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to run; Cmd/Ctrl+S to save as a query

Saved queries can be revisited and shared within your organization.

### Via API

HQL endpoints are namespaced under `/v1/helicone-sql` and require an authenticated request scoped to your organization.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.helicone.ai/v1/helicone-sql/execute" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HELICONE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sql": "SELECT request_model, COUNT() AS c FROM request_response_rmt GROUP BY request_model ORDER BY c DESC LIMIT 50"
  }'
```

Download large result sets as CSV:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.helicone.ai/v1/helicone-sql/download" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HELICONE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM request_response_rmt WHERE request_created_at >= toDateTime64(now(), 3) - INTERVAL 7 DAY"
  }'
```
