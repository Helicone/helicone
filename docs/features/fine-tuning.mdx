When building production AI applications, you need to improve model performance on specific tasks beyond what general-purpose models provide. Datasets & Fine-Tuning help you curate high-quality training data from your real production traffic and fine-tune models for better accuracy, consistency, and domain-specific performance.

## Why use Datasets & Fine-Tuning

- **Production-ready datasets**: Transform your actual LLM requests into high-quality training data with scoring and filtering
- **Seamless fine-tuning integration**: Export to JSONL or connect directly to fine-tuning platforms like OpenPipe
- **Iterative improvement**: Use real performance data to continuously refine your datasets and models

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Score Your Requests">
Review your existing LLM requests in the Helicone dashboard and assign quality scores based on accuracy and relevance. You can score manually or use [automated scoring](/features/advanced-usage/scores) to identify your best examples.

<Step title="Filter Requests">
Use Helicone's filtering system to find high-quality requests based on scores, dates, models, or custom properties.
