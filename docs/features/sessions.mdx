## Introduction

Helicone's Session management allows you to provide full control over any session and trace data that you send to Helicone. With Helicone, you can effortlessly monitor and manage your sessions and traces as they evolve.

### Why Sessions

Requests are now matched to a `helicone-session-id`, allowing you to:

- Manage and track sessions and traces over time
- Find long running traces or where in your session there are any issues

## Quick Start

Simply add a `Helicone-Session-Id` header to your request to start tracking your sessions and traces.

To represent parent and child traces we take advantange of a simple path syntax in the `Helicone-Session-Path` header. For example, if you have a parent trace `parent` and a child trace `child`, you can represent this as `/parent/child`.

Depending on your library you will need to add the following two headers to your request:

- `Helicone-Session-Id` - The session id you want to track
- `Helicone-Session-Path` - The path of the session

Here is an example is ts: [see other languages](/helicone-headers/header-directory)

```ts
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
  },
});

const session = randomUUID();

openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Generate an abstract for a course on space.",
      },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Session-Id": session,
      "Helicone-Session-Path": "/abstract",
    },
  }
);
```
