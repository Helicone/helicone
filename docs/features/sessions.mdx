## Introduction

Sessions in Helicone provide a powerful way to organize and analyze complex interactions within your LLM applications. By grouping related requests together, sessions offer a holistic view of user journeys, multi-step processes, or extended AI workflows. This feature is particularly valuable for applications that involve multiple back-and-forth exchanges or those that build upon previous context.

### Why Sessions

Sessions, identified by a `helicone-session-id` header, allow you to:

- Reconstruct the flow of a conversation or a multi-stage task
- Analyze performance and outcomes across entire interaction sequences
- Identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement in your AI workflows
- Gain deeper insights into user behavior and application patterns

## Quick Start

Simply add a `Helicone-Session-Id` header to your request to start tracking your sessions and traces.

To represent parent and child traces we take advantange of a simple path syntax in the `Helicone-Session-Path` header. For example, if you have a parent trace `parent` and a child trace `child`, you can represent this as `/parent/child`.

Depending on your library you will need to add the following three headers to your request:

- `Helicone-Session-Id` - The session id you want to track
- `Helicone-Session-Path` - The path of the session
- `Helicone-Session-Name` - The name of the session

Here is an example is ts: [see other languages](/helicone-headers/header-directory)

```ts
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://oai.helicone.ai/v1",
  defaultHeaders: {
    "Helicone-Auth": `Bearer ${process.env.HELICONE_API_KEY}`,
  },
});

const session = randomUUID();

openai.chat.completions.create(
  {
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Generate an abstract for a course on space.",
      },
    ],
    model: "gpt-4",
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Session-Id": session,
      "Helicone-Session-Path": "/abstract",
      "Helicone-Session-Name": "Course Plan",
    },
  }
);
```
