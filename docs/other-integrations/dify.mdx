  <Step title="Create an account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
