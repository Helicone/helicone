## Introduction

Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>

  <Step title="Configure API Base in Dify to use Helicone">

Choose whichever provider you are using that is [supported by Helicone](/getting-started/integration-method/gateway#approved-domains). Here is an example using OpenAI.
