## Introduction

Trieve is an open-source RAG + LLM platform. Its intuitive interface combines AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](/helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure API Base in Dify to use Helicone">

Choose whichever OpenAI compatible provider you are using that is [supported by Helicone](/getting-started/integration-method/gateway#approved-domains). Here is an example using OpenAI.

</Frame>

It's that simple!

  </Step>

    <Step title="Optional: Configure LLM Mapper">

NOTE: If you want to use a different provider you can try our new [llmmapper](/features/advanced-usage/llmmapper) feature.

<Frame caption="Set your API base to the Helicone API URL with your API key in the path.">
  <img src="/images/integrations/trieve-llmmapper.png" alt="trieve example" />
</Frame>

Set the base url to `https://llmmapper.helicone.ai/oai2ant/v1/{your_api_key}` and the api key to your write only api key. Now you can run trieve with Sonnet!
