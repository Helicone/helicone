## Introduction

MetaGPT is an open-source framework that simulates a software company workflow using multiple AI agents. It transforms one-line requirements into comprehensive software development outputs, including user stories, APIs, and documentation.

Integrating Helicone with MetaGPT allows you to monitor agent interactions and track performance across your AI-driven development process.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set base_url in the your config file">
You can configure your metagpt `config.yaml` and change the base_url to the following
  <CodeGroup>

```yaml config.yaml
llm:
  api_type: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4-turbo" # or gpt-3.5-turbo
  base_url: "https://oai.helicone.ai/{HELICONE_API_KEY}/v1"
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
