## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Helicone account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).
    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain Firecrawl API Key">
    Sign up for a Firecrawl account and obtain your API key from the [Firecrawl dashboard](https://firecrawl.dev).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make API Requests with Helicone Integration">
    Use the following cURL command as an example to make API requests to Firecrawl:

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://firecrawl.helicone.ai/v0/scrape \
      --header 'Helicone-Auth: YOUR_HELICONE_API_KEY' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY' \
      --header 'Helicone-Target-Url: https://api.firecrawl.dev' \
      --header 'Helicone-Target-Provider: Firecrawl' \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "url": "firecrawl.dev"
      }'
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_HELICONE_API_KEY` with your Helicone API key and `YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` with your Firecrawl API key.
