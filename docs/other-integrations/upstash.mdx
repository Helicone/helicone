## Introduction

Upstash QStash is a serverless message queue and task scheduler that seamlessly integrates with Helicone, allowing you to call any LLM asynchronously. This integration is particularly powerful for serverless environments, enabling you to overcome timeout limitations and efficiently manage LLM operations.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous LLM Calls**: Make non-blocking LLM requests, ideal for serverless architectures.
- **Support for Any LLM**: Use with any LLM provider while maintaining Helicone observability.
- **Serverless-Friendly**: Perfect for environments with execution time limits.
- **Extended Timeouts**: Up to 2 hours for long-running LLM tasks.
- **Automatic Retries**: Handles rate limit resets efficiently.
- **Batching Support**: Optimize large-scale LLM operations.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Helicone account + Generate an API Key">
    Log into [Helicone](https://www.helicone.ai) or create an account. Once you have an account, you
    can generate an [API key](https://helicone.ai/developer).

    <Note>
      Make sure to generate a [write only API key](helicone-headers/helicone-auth).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign up for Upstash QStash">
    Create an [Upstash account](https://upstash.com/) and obtain your QStash token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate QStash with Helicone">
    Use the QStash client with your Helicone API key:

    ```javascript
    import { Client, custom } from "@upstash/qstash";

    const client = new Client({ token: "<QSTASH_TOKEN>" });

    await client.publishJSON({
      api: {
        name: "llm",
        provider: custom({
          token: "YOUR_LLM_PROVIDER_TOKEN",
          baseUrl: "https://api.your-llm-provider.com",
        }),
        analytics: { name: "helicone", token: "YOUR_HELICONE_API_KEY" },
      },
      body: {
        model: "your-chosen-model",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Your message here" }],
      },
      callback: "https://your-callback-url.com",
    });
    ```
