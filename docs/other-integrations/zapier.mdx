## Introduction

Use the Helicone app on Zapier to generate chat completions from any supported model through the Helicone AI Gateway. Provide your Helicone API key, select a model, and pass your prompt data from any Zapier trigger — all with full observability in Helicone.

<Note>
  The Zapier action uses Helicone’s OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API. No OpenAI or third‑party provider keys are required when using the AI Gateway.
</Note>

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Helicone API key">
    Create a Helicone account at <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/" target="_blank">helicone.ai</a> and generate an
    <a href="https://us.helicone.ai/settings/api-keys" target="_blank">API key</a>.

    <Note>
      You can use a write-only key for logging requests. Learn more about
      <a href="/helicone-headers/header-directory">Helicone-Auth</a>.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Helicone app in Zapier">
    - In Zapier, create a new Zap (or edit an existing one).
    - For the Action step, search for and select "Helicone".
    - Choose the "Chat Completion" action.
    - When prompted, connect your Helicone account and paste your Helicone API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Chat Completion action">
    - Model: pick any supported model (see <a href="https://www.helicone.ai/models" target="_blank">model registry</a>).
    - Messages: map your trigger fields (e.g., prompt text) into the user message.
    - Optional: set temperature, max tokens, or system instructions.

    <Info>
      The action routes through Helicone’s AI Gateway. You can later change the target provider or model in Helicone without updating your Zap.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and publish your Zap">
    - Run a test to see the model’s response.
    - Publish the Zap when you’re satisfied.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify in Helicone">
    Open your Helicone dashboard and check the Requests tab to see your Zapier‑originated requests, costs, and latencies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Use Cases

- Auto‑draft replies from form submissions or support tickets
- Summarize new rows in Google Sheets or Airtable
- Generate product descriptions from e‑commerce triggers

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Helicone API key is valid and has write access.
- If a request fails, review the error in the Zap run details and the corresponding request in Helicone for provider/model‑specific messages.
- To switch models later, update the model field in the Zap action or use Helicone routing/policies to control traffic centrally.
