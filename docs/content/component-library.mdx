Mintlify provides a library of build-in-components to make your docs beautiful without formatting things yourself. They can be added **directly within your files**. Some components are rendered from [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), while other components work the same way as [React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

## Examples

### Code Blocks

The following example is a [Code](/writing-content/code) component, which lets you display syntax-highlighted code.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

It's rendered using the following code.

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

### Callouts

To present additional context outside of the main content, you can use a [Callout](/content/components/callouts) component. Find Warnings and Notes in addition to Tip callouts here.

<Tip>This suggests a helpful tip</Tip>

```md
<Tip>This suggests a helpful tip</Tip>
```

### Accordions

Use the [Accordian](/content/components/accordion) component to create a dropdown with additional content.

<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here.
</Accordion>

```md
<Accordion title="I am an Accordion.">
  You can put any content in here.
</Accordion>
```

### Cards

To highlight important points and links, you can use a [Card](/content/components/card) component.

<Card title="Click on me" icon="link" href="/content/components/card">
  This is how you use a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card
  brings you to the Card components page.
</Card>

```md
<Card title="Click on me" icon="link" href="/content/components/card">
  This is how you use a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card
  brings you to the Card components page.
</Card>
```
