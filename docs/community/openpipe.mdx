# Getting access

If you want access to OpenPipe you will need to join our [beta program](https://www.helicone.ai/integration/openpipe).
You can do this by contacting us on [here](https://www.helicone.ai/integration/openpipe).

# Getting started

Within the UI you can go to organization settings and then to the integrations tab. Here you can find the OpenPipe integration and click on it to get started.

You will need to enter your OpenPipe API key and then click on the save button.

# How it works

You can now start making calls to your LLMs and OpenPipe will start to learn from your calls. You can see the progress of this learning in the OpenPipe UI.
