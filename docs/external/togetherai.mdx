# Helicone Observability

Helicone is a streamlined tool that seamlessly integrates into any existing codebase, regardless of the programming language. This is achieved by providing a new base URL endpoint that proxies the traffic to TogetherAI.

Helicone offers a range of features, primarily used for:

- Data Ingestion and normalization with other LLM providers
- Prompt application analytics and insights
- Caching to economize on requests

# Getting Started

### 1. Create a Helicone Account

Start by creating a Helicone account and obtaining your API key from the [Helicone Dashboard](https://www.helicone.ai/signin).

### 2. Implement Helicone

Wherever you use the TogetherAI API, simply substitute the base URL with `https://together.hconeai.com` and include the `Helicone-Auth` header with your Helicone API key.

```python
TOGETHER_API_KEY = os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY")
HELICONE_API_KEY = os.environ.get("HELICONE_API_KEY")

client = OpenAI(
  api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY,
  # base_url='https://api.together.xyz/v1', Old
  base_url='https://together.hconeai.com/v1', # Change to Helicone
  default_headers={
    "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {HELICONE_API_KEY}", # Add Helicone API Key
  }
)
```

### 3. Start Utilizing Helicone

Congratulations! You are now using Helicone to proxy your requests to TogetherAI. You can now leverage Helicone's features such as data ingestion, caching, and analytics.
