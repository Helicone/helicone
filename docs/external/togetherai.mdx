# Helicone Observability

Helicone is a lightweight tool that connects directly into any of your existing code base, no matter the language. We do this by simpily providing a new base URL endpoint that proxies the traffic to TogetherAI.

Helicone enables a suite of features, but are mainly used for

- Data Ingest and data normalization with other LLM providers
- Prompt and application analytics and insights
- Caching to save money on requests

# Get started

### 1. Create a Helicone account

Create a Helicone account and get your API key from the [Helicone Dashboard](https://www.helicone.ai/signin).

### 2. Add Helicone

Anywhere you use the TogetherAI API, simply replace the base URL with `https://together.hconeai.com` and add the `Helicone-Auth` header with your Helicone API key.

```python
TOGETHER_API_KEY = os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY")
HELICONE_API_KEY = os.environ.get("HELICONE_API_KEY")

client = OpenAI(
  api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY,
  # base_url='https://api.together.xyz/v1', Old
  base_url='https://together.hconeai.com/v1', # Change to Helicone
  default_headers={
    "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer {HELICONE_API_KEY}", # Add Helicone API Key
  }
)
```

### 3. Start using Helicone

That's it! You're now using Helicone to proxy your requests to TogetherAI. You can now start using Helicone's features such as data ingestion, caching, and analytics.
