description: Predetermine Helicone's request ID for asynchronous utilization in other tasks

One of the significant advantages of using UUIDs as request IDs is the ability to predetermine the request ID before the actual request is dispatched to Helicone.

This feature facilitates the tracking of request IDs without the necessity of receiving a response from Helicone.

```python

import uuid

# Define request ID
my_helicone_request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Request to LLM provider
...
    "Helcione-Request-Id": my_helicone_request_id
...

# While the above code is executing, you can perform other tasks such as providing feedback on a specific request.
import requests
url = 'https://api.hconeai.com/v1/feedback'
headers = {
    'Helicone-Auth': 'YOUR_HELICONE_AUTH_HEADER',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
data = {
    'helicone-id': my_helicone_request_id,
    'rating': True # true for positive, false for negative
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

```

This functionality is particularly beneficial when associating different requests with different [jobs](/features/jobs/quick-start) or other features within Helicone.
