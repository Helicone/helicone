One of the nice things about having UUIDs as request IDs, is that we can predetermin the request ID before the actual request is sent over to Helicone.

This allows us to easily keep track of the request IDs without needed to get a response back from Helicone.

```python

import uuid

# Define request ID
my_helicone_request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Request to LLM provider
...
    "Helcione-Request-Id": my_helicone_request_id
...

# While the above code is running you an perform other tasks like giving feedback on a specific request.
import requests
url = 'https://api.hconeai.com/v1/feedback'
headers = {
    'Helicone-Auth': 'YOUR_HELICONE_AUTH_HEADER',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
data = {
    'helicone-id': my_helicone_request_id,
    'rating': True # true for positive, false for negative
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

```

This is also super useful when tagging different requests to different [jobs](/features/jobs/quick-start) or other features within Helicone.
