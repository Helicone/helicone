Ready to unlock the full power of the AI Gateway? This guide will walk you through creating custom routers with load balancing, caching, and rate limiting. You'll go from basic routing to production-ready configurations.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you've completed the [main quickstart](/ai-gateway/cloud-quickstart) so that you have setup
  your Helicone API keys and Provider API keys.
</Note>

## What Are Routers?

Think of routers as separate "virtual gateways" within the cloud hosted AI Gateway. Each router has its own:

- **URL endpoint** - `https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai/router/{id}`
- **Routing strategy** - How requests are distributed across providers
- **Provider pool** - Which LLM providers are available
- **Features** - Caching, rate limiting, retries, and more

This lets you have different configurations for different use cases - all configurable via a convenient GUI.

## Create Your First Router

### Step 1: Create the Router

Go to the [Gateway](https://us.helicone.ai/gateway) tab of Helicone
and click `Create Router`. This will take you to the following page:

### Step 2: Configure features

Now let's configure the features we want. Each feature has a toggle to enable
it as well as additional configuration to provide. When first enabled,
example values are populated to give an idea of how you can customize the
configuration. 

For example, toggling on caching will look like the following:

You may find a deep dive on each feature in the Concepts section, for example
the [caching concepts page](/ai-gateway/concepts/cache).

### Step 3: Save your router

Once you've configured the router to your liking, hit the `Create Router` button
and your router will be saved and your virtual gateway deployed to the Helicone
Cloud within a few seconds.

Optionally, you may also manually customize the YAML configuration directly
after creation. There is a YAML configuration reference page available
[here](/ai-gateway/config).


### Step 4: Use in Your Applications

After creating your router, you will be shown a modal with an easy to copy
snippet for testing your new router!

![How to use Router](/ai-gateway/images/how-to-use-cloud-router.webp)

Just change the base URL to use different routers. Remember to use your Helicone API key for authentication:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai/router/nqek3r1pyex1",
    # Your Helicone API key
    api_key="sk-helicone-..."
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Production
const prodClient = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://ai-gateway.helicone.ai/router/nqek3r1pyex1',
  // Your Helicone API key
  apiKey: 'sk-helicone-...'
});
```
</CodeGroup>


### Step 5: Update the router configuration if needed.

If you would like to update the router configuration, you may easily do so!

For example, if I wanted to disable caching, I would go to the Routers tab
on the [Helicone Gateway page](https://us.helicone.ai/gateway) and click on
the router I want to update.

Then, click the `Configuration` button in the top right, and manually edit
the YAML as needed. Support for the GUI config editor for updating configs is coming soon.

After you click `Save Configuration`, the update will be propagated to the 
Cloud Helicone Gateway within a few seconds and will automatically be live.
