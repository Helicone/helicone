Deploy the AI Gateway to Fly.io for a simple, scalable cloud deployment with automatic scaling and global distribution.

<Warning>
  **Security Notice**: Fly.io deployments are publicly accessible. You **must** enable authentication to prevent unauthorized access to your provider API keys. This guide includes authentication setup as a required step.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Fly CLI">
    Install the Fly.io CLI tool:

    ```bash
    # macOS (with Homebrew)
    brew install flyctl

    # macOS/Linux (without Homebrew)
    curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

    # Windows
    pwsh -Command "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"
    ```

    <Note>
      If you encounter any issues with installation, refer to the [official Fly.io installation guide](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Helicone API key">
    The AI Gateway configuration has authentication enabled by default to secure your public deployment. You'll need a Helicone API key to authenticate requests.

    Create your Helicone API key:

    1. Go to [Helicone Settings](https://us.helicone.ai/settings/api-keys)
    2. Click **"Generate New Key"**
    3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-helicone-`)
    4. Save it securely - you'll need it for deployment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the fly.toml configuration">
    Download the official fly.toml configuration from our GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    curl -o fly.toml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helicone/ai-gateway/main/fly.toml
    ```

    <Note>
      This configuration file contains all the necessary settings for deploying the AI Gateway to Fly.io.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch and deploy">
    Launch your app with Fly.io:

    ```bash
    fly launch
    ```

    This command will:
    - Automatically prompt you to log in if needed
    - Create the app with a unique name
    - Set up your deployment
    - Deploy your AI Gateway

    The deployment will complete, but you'll need to add your API keys next.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure authentication & API keys">
    **Enable authentication** to secure your public deployment, then add your provider API keys:

    ```bash
    # REQUIRED: Enable authentication
    fly secrets set HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY="sk-helicone-your-key-from-step-2"

    # Provider API keys (add the ones you need)
    fly secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_openai_key>"
    fly secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your_anthropic_key>"
    fly secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY="<your_gemini_key>"
    ```

    <Note>
      Use the Helicone API key you created in step 2. This enables secure authentication for your gateway.
    </Note>

    <Accordion title="Prefer to use the web UI?">
      You can also add secrets through the Fly.io dashboard:

      1. Go to [fly.io/dashboard](https://fly.io/dashboard)
      2. Select your newly created app
      3. Navigate to the **Secrets** tab
      4. Add your environment variables there
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy with secrets">
    After adding your environment variables, redeploy to apply them:

    ```bash
    fly deploy
    ```

    Your AI Gateway is now fully configured and ready to use!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test your AI Gateway with authentication:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://your-app-name.fly.dev/ai",
  apiKey: "sk-helicone-your-api-key", // Your Helicone API key
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello from Fly.io!" }],
});

console.log(response);
```
```python Python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://your-app-name.fly.dev/ai",
    api_key="sk-helicone-your-api-key"  # Your Helicone API key
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Fly.io!"}]
)

print(response)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://your-app-name.fly.dev/ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello from Fly.io!" }
    ]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Replace `sk-helicone-your-api-key` with your actual Helicone API key for secure access to your gateway.
</Note>


## Using a Configuration File

The default fly.toml includes a basic router configuration, but you can customize it for your specific needs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom config file">
    Create a `config.yaml` file in your project directory:

    ```yaml
    server:
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 8080

    routers:
      my-router:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers:
              - openai
              - anthropic

    helicone:
      # Set to `features: observability` to enable observability
      features: auth
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update fly.toml">
    Modify the `[[files]]` section in your `fly.toml` to use your local config file:

    ```toml
    [[files]]
      guest_path = '/app/config/config.yaml'
      local_path = './config.yaml'
    ```

    Replace the existing `raw_value` line with `local_path` pointing to your config file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy">
    Deploy to apply your changes:

    ```bash
    fly deploy
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
