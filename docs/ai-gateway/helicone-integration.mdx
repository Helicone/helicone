The AI Gateway integrates with Helicone to provide secure authentication and comprehensive observability for your AI requests. When enabled, the gateway requires valid Helicone API keys and automatically logs all requests to your Helicone dashboard.

**Benefits:**
- **Secure your gateway** by requiring valid API keys for all requests
- **Monitor usage and costs** across all providers in one dashboard
- **Track performance** with detailed request/response analytics
- **Debug issues** with comprehensive request tracing

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your Helicone API key">
    Add your Helicone API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Helicone integration">
    Create or update your `ai-gateway-config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    helicone-observability:
      enable-auth: true
    
    routers:
      default:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers:
              - openai
              - anthropic
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with authentication">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/default/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
      }'
    ```
    
    âœ… Check your [Helicone dashboard](https://us.helicone.ai) to see the request logged automatically!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Security Warning**: Without authentication enabled or limited network access, anyone with access to your AI Gateway can use your provider API keys. Enable Helicone integration to secure your deployment.
</Note>

## How It Works

When enabled, the AI Gateway connects to Helicone's control plane for authentication and automatically logs all requests for observability.

<Steps>
  <Step title="WebSocket Connection">
    Gateway establishes persistent connection to Helicone control plane with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="API Key Sync">
    Authorized API keys and user data are cached locally for fast validation and resilience during network issues
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request Validation">
    Incoming requests are validated against cached keys with graceful degradation - cached keys continue working during temporary connectivity issues
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Logging">
    All authenticated requests are automatically sent to your Helicone dashboard for observability and cost tracking
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production - Secure & Observable">
    **Use case:** Production deployment requiring authentication and full observability.

    ```yaml
    helicone-observability:
      enable-auth: true
    ```
    
    **Environment variables:**
    ```bash
    HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```

    **Result:** All requests require valid Helicone API keys and are automatically logged to your dashboard.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Helicone">
    **Use case:** Using a self-hosted Helicone instance with custom endpoints.

    ```yaml
    helicone-observability:
      enable-auth: true
      base-url: "https://helicone.your-domain.com"
      websocket-url: "wss://helicone.your-domain.com/ws/v1/router/control-plane"
    ```
    
    **Environment variables:**
    ```bash
    HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secure Network - Auth Disabled">
    **Use case:** Deployment within a secure network (VPN, private cloud) where network-level access control provides security.

    ```yaml
    helicone-observability:
      enable-auth: false
    ```
    
    **Result:** No authentication required, no automatic logging to Helicone. Network security controls access.
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Authentication & Usage

When authentication is enabled (`enable-auth: true`), include your Helicone API key with every request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/default/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-abc123def456" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

The gateway validates keys in real-time through a persistent WebSocket connection to Helicone's control plane. Keys are cached locally for resilience during network issues, and all authenticated requests are automatically logged to your [Helicone dashboard](https://docs.helicone.ai/observability/overview).

<Note>
  For complete configuration options, see the [Configuration Reference](/ai-gateway/config#helicone-add-ons).
</Note>

## Security & Privacy

**Access Control:** Requests without valid Helicone API keys are rejected with 401 Unauthorized. Your provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) remain secure in the gateway environment and are never transmitted to Helicone.

**Data Handling:** Request and response data is automatically logged for observability. To exclude sensitive data from logs, use these headers:
- `x-helicone-omit-request-log: true` - Skip request body logging
- `x-helicone-omit-response-log: true` - Skip response body logging

All data transmission to Helicone uses TLS encryption.
