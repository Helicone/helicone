Deploy the AI Gateway to Porter for a simple, scalable cloud deployment with an intuitive web interface and automatic infrastructure management.

<Warning>
  **Security Notice**: Porter deployments are publicly accessible. You **must** enable authentication to prevent unauthorized access to your provider API keys. This guide includes authentication setup as a required step.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Porter account">
    Sign up for Porter and set up your infrastructure:

    1. Go to [Porter](https://porter.run) and create an account
    2. Follow Porter's onboarding process to connect your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
    3. Porter will guide you through creating your first cluster
    4. Complete the cluster setup - this will be your deployment target

    <Note>
      Porter handles all the infrastructure complexity for you. The onboarding process typically takes 5-10 minutes and includes automatic cluster provisioning.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Helicone API key">
    The AI Gateway requires authentication to secure your public deployment. You'll need a Helicone API key to authenticate requests.

    Create your Helicone API key:

    1. Go to [Helicone Settings](https://us.helicone.ai/settings/api-keys)
    2. Click **"Generate New Key"**
    3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-helicone-`)
    4. Save it securely - you'll need it for deployment

    <Note>
      No Helicone subscription is required, but the API key is essential for securing your publicly accessible gateway.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the Helicone AI Gateway Add-on">
    Access Porter's marketplace:

    1. Log into your Porter dashboard
    2. Navigate to **"Add-ons"** in the sidebar
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter1.webp)
    3. Click **"New Add-on"** to browse the marketplace
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter2.webp)
    4. Click on the Helicone AI Gateway tile
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter3.webp)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure deployment settings">
    Fill out the deployment configuration:

    **Basic Settings:**
    - **Deployment Target**: Select your cluster (created during Porter onboarding)
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter-target.webp)
    - **Add-on Name**: Choose any name for your gateway (e.g., "my-ai-gateway")
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter-name.webp)

    **Helicone Configuration:**
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter-expose.webp)
    - **Expose to External Traffic**: ✅ **Turn this ON** (required for public access)
    - **Custom Domain** (Optional): Specify your own domain if desired
    - **Helicone API Key**: ⚠️ **REQUIRED** - Enter your API key from Step 2
    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter-hkey.webp)

    <Warning>
      The Helicone API Key is mandatory for authentication. Without it, your gateway will be publicly accessible without security.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure provider API keys">
    Enable the LLM providers you want to use:

    ![Porter Add-ons](../images/porter-keys.webp)

    **Provider Configuration:**
    - **OpenAI**: Toggle on and enter your OpenAI API key
    - **Anthropic**: Toggle on and enter your Anthropic API key  
    - **Gemini**: Toggle on and enter your Google Gemini API key
    - **Other Providers**: Enable additional providers as needed

    **Optional Settings:**
    - **Helicone Observability**: Toggle on to enable request logging and analytics
    - **Custom Config**: Upload a `config.yaml` file for advanced routing (optional)

    <Note>
      Only enable providers you plan to use. You can always add more providers later by updating your deployment.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your gateway">
    Complete the deployment:

    1. Review all your configuration settings
    2. Click **"Deploy"** to start the deployment process
    3. Porter will build and deploy your AI Gateway
    4. Wait for the deployment status to show **"Running"**

    <Note>
      Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes. Porter will show real-time status updates during the process.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, Porter will provide you with a public URL. Test your AI Gateway with authentication:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://your-gateway-url.porter.run/ai", // Use your Porter URL
  apiKey: "sk-helicone-your-api-key", // Your Helicone API key
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello from Porter!" }],
});

console.log(response);
```
```python Python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://your-gateway-url.porter.run/ai",  # Use your Porter URL
    api_key="sk-helicone-your-api-key"  # Your Helicone API key
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Porter!"}]
)

print(response)
```
```bash cURL
curl https://your-gateway-url.porter.run/ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello from Porter!" }
    ]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Replace `your-gateway-url.porter.run` with your actual Porter deployment URL and `sk-helicone-your-api-key` with your Helicone API key.
</Note>

## Custom Configuration

For advanced use cases, you can upload a custom `config.yaml` file during deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom config file">
    Create a `config.yaml` file with your desired configuration:

    ```yaml
    server:
      address: 0.0.0.0
      port: 8080

    routers:
      my-router:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers:
              - openai
              - anthropic
        cache:
          enabled: true
          ttl: 3600
        rate-limit:
          requests_per_minute: 1000

    helicone:
      # Set to `features: observability` to enable observability
      features: auth
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload during deployment">
    In the Porter configuration UI:

    1. Scroll to the **"Custom Config"** section
    2. Click **"Upload File"** 
    3. Select your `config.yaml` file
    4. Continue with the deployment process

    <Note>
      Custom configurations override the default settings. Make sure your config includes all necessary authentication settings.
    </Note>
