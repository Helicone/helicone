# Why we're building the AI Gateway?

The AI development space is progressing at an exponential rate. We see it every day at Heliconeâ€”over 90 % of our users run 5 + LLMs in production, each with its own SDK, auth scheme, rate limits, and quirks.

Keeping up today means rewriting integrations for every new model, managing a maze of API keys, engineering custom fallbacks for provider outages, and constantly tuning traffic for cost or compliance.

Helicone AI Gateway is our answer. It is a lightweight Rust router inspired by NGINX that removes the integration tax so you can focus on shipping features.

# What sets our AI Gateway apart?

Built in Rust, the Gateway ships as one lightweight binary you can run anywhere:

- **Self-hosted by default** - deployable standalone or with Redis and Helicone for additional features
- **Sidecar-friendly** - drop into Docker, Kubernetes, bare-metal, or spawn as a subprocess
- **Built with Tower** - Configurable middleware that leverages the Tower ecosystem
- **NGINX-style proxy** - local gateway to any provider, model, or region
- **Horizontally scalable** - run 1-N instances behind any load balancer
- **Open-source** - Apache licensed, no vendor lock-in
