<Warning>
  **Authentication Required**: Observability requires Helicone authentication to be enabled. Please complete the [Authentication setup](/ai-gateway/authentication) first before enabling observability.
</Warning>

Enable observability to automatically log all requests to your Helicone dashboard for monitoring usage, costs, and performance across all providers.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your Helicone API key">
    Add your Helicone API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Helicone observability">
    Create or update your `ai-gateway-config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    helicone:
      # also enables authentication
      features: observability
    
    routers:
      my-router:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers:
              - openai
              - anthropic
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway@latest --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make requests">
    Since authentication is enabled, you must include your Helicone API key:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/chat/completions \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
      }'
    ```
    âœ… Check your [Helicone dashboard](https://us.helicone.ai) to see requests logged automatically!
  </Step>
