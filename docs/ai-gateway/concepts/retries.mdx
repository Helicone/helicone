## Introduction

The AI Gateway automatically retries transient errors from AI providers using configurable strategies, improving reliability without overwhelming providers with rapid successive requests.

Retries use smart failure detection with configurable maximum attempts, backoff timing, and are configurable either globally or per-router.

## Why Use Retries

- **Improve reliability** by automatically recovering from transient provider failures
- **Handle network issues** by retrying requests that fail due to connectivity problems  
- **Maintain user experience** by transparently recovering from failures
- **Reduce manual intervention** by automatically handling temporary service disruptions

<Info>
  **Rate limit handling is automatic** - when providers return 429 status codes, the AI Gateway automatically removes them from load balancing rotation. Retries are for handling other types of failures like 5xx errors or network issues.
</Info>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your configuration">
    Create `ai-gateway-config.yaml` with basic retry configuration (3 retries with 50ms constant delay):

    ```yaml
    global:
      retries:
        strategy: "constant"
        delay: "50ms"
        max-retries: 3
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway@latest --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test retries">
    Send a request to a provider that might have transient failures. The gateway will automatically retry 5xx errors and network issues:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ai/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
      }'
    ```
    
    ✅ If the provider returns a 5xx error or network issue, the gateway will automatically retry up to 3 times with 50ms delays!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  For complete configuration options and syntax, see the [Configuration Reference](/ai-gateway/config#retries).

## Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production API - Reliable Service">
    **Use case:** Production API that needs high reliability and can tolerate slightly higher latency for better success rates.

    ```yaml
    global:
      retries:
        strategy: "constant"
        delay: "50ms"
        max-retries: 3
    ```
    
    **Total retry time:** Up to 7 seconds
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Batch Processing - Maximum Reliability">
    **Use case:** Background batch processing where reliability is more important than latency.

    ```yaml
    global:
      retries:
        strategy: "exponential"
        min-delay: "200ms"
        max-delay: "60s"
        max-retries: 5
        factor: 2.0
    ```
    
    **Total retry time:** Up to 62 seconds
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Real-time Applications">
    **Use case:** Real-time applications that need quick failure detection with minimal retry overhead.

    ```yaml
    global:
      retries:
        strategy: "constant"
        delay: "25ms"
        max-retries: 2
    ```
    
    **Total retry time:** Up to 1.5 seconds
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="High-Volume Processing">
    **Use case:** High-volume processing with moderate reliability requirements.

    ```yaml
    global:
      retries:
        strategy: "exponential"
        min-delay: "50ms"
        max-delay: "5s"
        max-retries: 3
        factor: 1.5
    ```
    
    **Total retry time:** Up to 8 seconds
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Retries Work

The AI Gateway automatically retries failed requests using the configured strategy with smart failure detection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Fails">
    Request fails with a retryable error (5xx server error or network issue)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait Period">
    AI Gateway waits for the calculated backoff period based on the configured strategy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Retry Request">
    Request is retried with the same parameters to the same provider
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repeat or Return">
    Process repeats until success or max retries reached
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Retry Strategies

#### Constant Strategy
Fixed delay between retry attempts with jitter to prevent thundering herd.

```yaml
retries:
  strategy: "constant"
  delay: "50ms"
  max-retries: 3
```

**Timing:** 50ms → 100ms → 150ms → fail

#### Exponential Strategy  
Exponentially increasing delays with jitter and configurable bounds.

```yaml
retries:
  strategy: "exponential"
  min-delay: "200ms"
  max-delay: "60s"
  max-retries: 5
  factor: 2.0
```

**Timing:** 200ms → 400ms → 800ms → 1.6s → 3.2s → fail

### What Gets Retried

| Condition | Retried? | Reason | Examples |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| **5xx Server Errors** | ✅ Yes | Temporary provider issues | `500 Internal Server Error`, `502 Bad Gateway`, `503 Service Unavailable`, `504 Gateway Timeout` |
| **Network Transport Errors** | ✅ Yes | Connection/network problems | Connection refused, timeouts, DNS failures, TLS handshake errors |
| **Stream Interruptions** | ✅ Yes | Streaming response failures | Stream ended unexpectedly, transport errors during streaming |
| **4xx Client Errors** | ❌ No | Request format/auth issues | `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `422 Unprocessable Entity` |
| **429 Rate Limits** | ❌ No | Handled by load balancing | Provider temporarily removed from rotation based on `Retry-After` header |
| **2xx Success Responses** | ❌ No | Request succeeded | `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `202 Accepted` |
| **Auth/Config Errors** | ❌ No | Setup/configuration issues | Invalid Helicone API keys, missing auth headers, provider not configured |
| **Cache/Storage Errors** | ❌ No | Persistent storage issues | Cache operation failures, malformed request/response bodies |

### Load Balancing Integration

Retries and [load balancing](/ai-gateway/features/loadbalancing) work together to maximize reliability:

- **Per-request:** When a request fails, retries attempt the same provider multiple times
- **Per-provider:** If a provider keeps failing requests, health monitoring removes it from the load balancer  
- **Result:** New requests automatically go to healthy providers while failed requests still get retried

### Jitter and Backoff

All retry strategies include automatic jitter to prevent thundering herd problems:

- **Constant strategy:** ±25% random variation in delay timing
- **Exponential strategy:** ±25% random variation at each backoff level

You can override global retry settings for specific routers by adding a `retries` section to individual router configurations.
