---

Routers are the core concept of the Helicone AI Gateway. Unlike alternative solutions, it allows you to configure multiple independent routing policies within a single gateway deployment, each with its own load balancing strategy, provider configuration, and middleware settings.

## Getting Started

### What are Routers?

Routers define independent routing policies within the AI Gateway, each with its own configuration for:
- **Load balancing strategies** - How requests are distributed across providers
- **Provider selection** - Which LLM providers are available for each router
- **Middleware settings** - Caching, rate limiting, retries, and other features
- **URL endpoints** - Each router gets its own URL path for requests

Think of routers as separate "virtual gateways" within a single deployment - each optimized for different use cases, environments, or teams.

### Understanding Router URLs

Each router you define becomes part of the URL path when making requests to the gateway. This design allows a single deployed gateway to serve multiple routing configurations.

**URL Format:** `http://your-gateway-host/router/{router-name}/{api-path}`

<CodeGroup>
```bash Production Router
# Using the 'production' router
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/production/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

```bash Development Router  
# Using the 'development' router
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/development/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

```bash Default Router
# Using the 'default' router (special case)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/default/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### SDK Configuration

Configure your OpenAI SDK to use a specific router by setting the base URL:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import openai

# Production router
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/router/production",
    api_key="sk-placeholder"  # Required by SDK, but gateway handles real auth
)

# Development router
dev_client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/router/development", 
    api_key="sk-placeholder"  # Required by SDK, but gateway handles real auth
)
```

```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Production router
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/router/production',
  apiKey: 'sk-placeholder'  // Required by SDK, but gateway handles real auth
});

// Development router
const devClient = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/router/development',
  apiKey: 'sk-placeholder'  // Required by SDK, but gateway handles real auth
});
```

```bash cURL
# Production router
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/production/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'

# Development router  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/development/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Basic Router Configuration

Every AI Gateway deployment requires at least a `default` router. You can then add additional named routers for different use cases.

```yaml
routers:
  # Required: default router
  default:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - openai
          - anthropic
  
  # Optional: additional named routers
  production:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: weighted
        providers:
          - provider: anthropic
            weight: '0.7'
          - provider: openai
            weight: '0.3'
    cache:
      enabled: true
      directive: "max-age=3600"
    
  development:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - ollama
          - openai
```

## Common Use Cases

## Reference

### Router Naming Rules

- Router names must be 1-12 characters long
- Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores allowed: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`
- `default` is a special reserved name for the default router
- Case-insensitive for the `default` router only

**Valid names:** `production`, `dev`, `team-a`, `cost_opt`, `v2`  
**Invalid names:** `very-long-router-name`, `team@prod`, `router with spaces`

### URL Path Structure

The AI Gateway supports three different routing patterns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Router-Based Routing (Recommended)">
    **Pattern:** `/router/{name}/{api-path}`
    
    **Examples:**
    - `/router/production/v1/chat/completions`
    - `/router/development/v1/chat/completions`
    - `/router/cost-optimized/v1/embeddings`
    
    **Features:**
    - Full router configuration support
    - Load balancing, caching, retries
    - Router-specific rate limiting
    - Model mapping
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Direct Provider Routing">
    **Pattern:** `/{provider}/{api-path}`
    
    **Examples:**
    - `/openai/v1/chat/completions`
    - `/anthropic/v1/messages`
    - `/google/v1beta/generateContent`
    
    **Features:**
    - Direct proxy to specific provider
    - No load balancing or router features
    - Global rate limiting only
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unified API Routing">
    **Pattern:** `/ai/{api-path}`
    
    **Examples:**
    - `/ai/v1/chat/completions`
    
    **Features:**
    - Automatic provider detection from model name
    - Limited to OpenAI-compatible endpoints
    - No router-specific configuration
  </Accordion>
