description: "Secure API key management for multiple LLM providers with automatic discovery"
---

The AI Gateway securely manages API keys and sensitive credentials for all configured LLM providers using environment variables with automatic discovery and secure handling.

**Benefits:**
- **Centralize credential access** so developers only need the router URL, not individual provider API keys
- **Reduce credential sprawl** by keeping all provider secrets in one secure location instead of distributing them
- **Simplify configuration** with automatic API key discovery based on configured providers
- **Enable multi-provider setups** by managing credentials for multiple LLM providers simultaneously

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your provider API keys">
    Set environment variables for the providers you want to use:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your providers">
    Create `ai-gateway-config.yaml` with your desired providers:

    ```yaml
    routers:
      default:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers:
              - openai      # Uses OPENAI_API_KEY
              - anthropic   # Uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
              - gemini      # Uses GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test secret management">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/default/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
      }'
    ```
    
    âœ… The gateway automatically uses the correct API key for whichever provider it routes to!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Storage Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables - Default" icon="gear">
    **Local environment variable storage**
    
    The AI Gateway automatically discovers and loads API keys from environment variables based on your configuration. It looks for `{PROVIDER_NAME}_API_KEY` environment variables for each configured provider.
    
    **Best for:** Most deployments, development environments, and simple production setups
    
    **How it works:**
    1. **Read configuration** - Identifies which providers are configured in your routers
    2. **Load environment variables** - Looks for `{PROVIDER_NAME}_API_KEY` for each provider
    3. **Validate at request time** - Checks for required API keys when a request is routed to a specific provider
    
    **Example:**
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
    ```
    
    ```yaml
    routers:
      default:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers: [openai, anthropic]
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Cloud secret manager integrations (AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) are [coming soon](#coming-soon) for enterprise deployments.
</Note>

## Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production API - Multi-Provider">
    **Use case:** Production environment using multiple cloud providers for reliability and cost optimization.

    ```bash
    # Set API keys for configured providers
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
    ```

    ```yaml
    routers:
      production:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers: [openai, anthropic, gemini]
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Development - Local + Cloud">
    **Use case:** Development setup using local Ollama models for testing and cloud providers for comparison.

    ```bash
    # Only need keys for cloud providers
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    # Ollama runs locally, no key needed
    ```

    ```yaml
    routers:
      development:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: weighted
            providers:
              - provider: ollama     # No API key required
                weight: 0.8
              - provider: openai     # Requires OPENAI_API_KEY
                weight: 0.2
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-Environment Deployment">
    **Use case:** Different environments with different provider configurations and API key management.

    ```bash
    # Production
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-prod-..."
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-prod-..."

    # Staging
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-staging-..."
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-staging-..."

    # Development - Local only
    # No API keys needed for Ollama
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

### Request Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration Read">
    Gateway reads your configuration and identifies which providers are configured across all routers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Environment Variable Discovery">
    Gateway automatically looks for `{PROVIDER_NAME}_API_KEY` environment variables for each configured provider
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request Arrives">
    A request comes in and the load balancer selects a provider based on your strategy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="API Key Validation">
    Gateway checks if the required API key is available for the selected provider
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Secure Forwarding">
    Request is forwarded to the provider with the appropriate API key, keeping credentials secure from the client
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Providers

The AI Gateway supports API key management for the following providers:

| Provider         | Environment Variable  | Required | Notes                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| **OpenAI**       | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Yes      | Standard OpenAI API key         |
| **Anthropic**    | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | Yes      | Claude API key                  |
| **Gemini**       | `GEMINI_API_KEY`     | Yes      | Google AI Studio API key        |
| **AWS Bedrock**  | `BEDROCK_API_KEY`    | Yes      | AWS access key                  |
| **VertexAI**     | `VERTEXAI_API_KEY`   | Yes      | GCP service account key         |
| **Ollama**       | N/A                  | No       | Local deployment, no key needed |

<Note>
  You only need to set environment variables for providers you actually use. If you make a request to a provider without a configured API key, the request will fail with a clear error message.
</Note>

### Error Handling

The AI Gateway provides clear error messages for secret management issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Provider Keys Not Found" icon="key">
    **Error:** No API keys loaded for the router
    
    ```
    Error: Provider keys not found for router: production
    ```
    
    **Solution:** Ensure environment variables are set for all providers used in your router configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Failures" icon="x">
    **Error:** Provider rejects the API key during request
    
    ```
    HTTP 401 Unauthorized from provider
    ```
    
    **Solution:** Verify your API key is valid and has the required permissions with the provider. Authentication errors come directly from the provider's API, not the gateway.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Environment Variables" icon="gear">
    **Behavior:** Requests to providers without API keys will fail
    
    If you configure a provider in your router but don't set the corresponding environment variable, requests to that provider will fail when attempted.
    
    **Solution:** Set the required environment variables:
    - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` 
    - Gemini: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    - AWS Bedrock: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` + `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Isolation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Router-Only Access">
    Keep provider keys in the router infrastructure only - developers and applications never handle actual provider API keys
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Environment Variable Security">
    Only the router instances need access to `{PROVIDER_NAME}_API_KEY` environment variables
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Client Authentication">
    Applications authenticate with the router URL instead of individual providers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Optional Gateway Authentication">
    Optionally enable Helicone authentication to require API keys for router access
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Observability & Monitoring

Track usage and security through integrated monitoring:

- **Monitor API key usage** - Track costs and request traces per provider
- **Audit logs** - See which requests used which provider keys  
- **Cost alerts** - Set up usage monitoring and alerts per provider
- **Request tracing** - Full observability through Helicone integration
