Ready to unlock the full power of the AI Gateway? This guide will walk you through creating custom routers with load balancing, caching, and multiple environments. You'll go from basic routing to production-ready configurations.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** Make sure you've completed the [main quickstart](/ai-gateway/quickstart) and have the gateway running with your API keys configured.
</Note>

## What Are Routers?

Think of routers as separate "virtual gateways" within your single AI Gateway deployment. Each router has its own:

- **URL endpoint** - `http://localhost:8080/router/{name}/v1/chat/completions`
- **Load balancing strategy** - How requests are distributed across providers
- **Provider pool** - Which LLM providers are available
- **Features** - Caching, rate limiting, retries, and more

This lets you have different configurations for different use cases - all from one gateway deployment.

## Create Your First Router

### Step 1: Basic Router Setup

Let's start with a basic router configuration. Create a file called `ai-gateway-config.yaml`:

```yaml
routers:
  my-router:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - openai
          - anthropic
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a router named `my-router` 
- Available at `http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/v1/chat/completions`
- Uses [latency-based load balancing](/ai-gateway/concepts/loadbalancing#latency-based-p2c-peakewma-default) between OpenAI and Anthropic
- Automatically routes to whichever provider responds fastest

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save the configuration">
    Save the YAML above as `ai-gateway-config.yaml` in your current directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway start --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your router">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```typescript TypeScript
    import { OpenAI } from "openai";

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: "http://localhost:8080/router/my-router",
      apiKey: "fake-api-key", // Required by SDK, but gateway handles real auth
    });

    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello from my custom router!" }],
    });

    console.log(response);
    ```
    ```python Python
    import openai

    openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8080/router/my-router"
    openai.api_key = "fake-api-key" # Required by SDK, but gateway handles real auth

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from my custom router!"}]
    )
    ```
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from my custom router!"}]
      }'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** Your request was automatically load-balanced between OpenAI and Anthropic based on which responds faster.

### Step 2: Add Intelligent Caching

Now let's add caching to dramatically reduce costs and improve response times:

```yaml
routers:
  my-router:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - openai
          - anthropic
    cache:
      enabled: true
      directive: "max-age=3600"  # Cache for 1 hour
      buckets: 1                 # Single response per cache key
```

**What this adds:**
- Caches identical requests for 1 hour
- Subsequent identical requests return instantly from cache
- Can reduce costs by 90%+ for repeated requests

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update your configuration">
    Replace your `ai-gateway-config.yaml` with the configuration above.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway start --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test caching">
    Make the same request twice and notice the second one is much faster:
    
    ```bash
    # First request - goes to provider
    time curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}]}'
    
    # Second request - returns from cache instantly
    time curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}]}'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Multiple Environments

Real applications need different configurations for different environments. Let's create production and development routers:

```yaml
routers:
  production:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - openai
          - anthropic
          - google
    cache:
      enabled: true
      directive: "max-age=1800"  # 30 minutes for production freshness
    rate-limit:
      per-api-key:
        capacity: 1000
        refill-frequency: 1m      # 1000 requests per minute
  
  development:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: weighted
        providers:
          - provider: ollama        # Free local models
            weight: '0.8'
          - provider: openai        # Paid fallback
            weight: '0.2'
    cache:
      enabled: true
      directive: "max-age=7200"    # 2 hours to reduce dev costs
    rate-limit:
      per-api-key:
        capacity: 100
        refill-frequency: 1h      # 100 requests per hour for cost safety
  
  staging:
    load-balance:
      chat:
        strategy: latency
        providers:
          - openai
          - anthropic
    cache:
      enabled: false              # No caching for testing
    rate-limit:
      per-api-key:
        capacity: 200
        refill-frequency: 1m      # 200 requests per minute for testing
```

**What this creates:**

| Router | Endpoint | Strategy | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **production** | `/router/production/...` | Latency + rate limits | Customer traffic |
| **development** | `/router/development/...` | Weighted (80% local) | Cost-effective dev |
| **staging** | `/router/staging/...` | Latency (no cache) | Testing |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update configuration">
    Replace your `ai-gateway-config.yaml` with the multi-environment config above.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway start --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test different environments">
    ```bash
    # Production router - optimized for reliability
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/production/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Production test"}]}'
    
    # Development router - cost-optimized with local models
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/development/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"model": "llama3.2", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Development test"}]}'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Use in Your Applications

Now update your applications to use specific routers:

<CodeGroup>
```python Production App
import openai

# Production router with rate limiting
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/router/production",
    api_key="sk-placeholder"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from production!"}]
)
```

```python Development App
import openai

# Development router with cost optimization
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/router/development", 
    api_key="sk-placeholder"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama3.2",  # Will use local Ollama 80% of the time
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello from development!"}]
)
```

```javascript Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Production router
const prodClient = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/router/production',
  apiKey: 'sk-placeholder'
});

// Development router  
const devClient = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/router/development',
  apiKey: 'sk-placeholder'
});
```
