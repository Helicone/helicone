To deploy a secure AI Gateway, you have two options:

1. **Secure Network Deployment** - Deploy in a secure network (VPN, private cloud) where network-level access control provides security
2. **Public Network with Authentication** - Deploy on a public network and use Helicone authentication to secure your gateway

<Note>
  **If you're deploying in a secure network with proper access controls, you can skip the rest of this guide.** Authentication is only required for public deployments or when you need user-level access control.
</Note>

The AI Gateway integrates with Helicone to provide secure authentication for your AI requests. When enabled, the gateway requires valid Helicone API keys for all requests, ensuring only authorized users can access your provider API keys.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your Helicone API key">
    Add your Helicone API key as an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Helicone authentication">
    Create or update your `ai-gateway-config.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    helicone:
      # Set to `features: observability` to enable both auth and observability
      features: auth
    
    routers:
      my-router:
        load-balance:
          chat:
            strategy: latency
            providers:
              - openai
              - anthropic
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the gateway">
    ```bash
    npx @helicone/ai-gateway@latest --config ai-gateway-config.yaml
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with authentication">
    Now you must include your Helicone API key in the request.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/chat/completions \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-your-api-key" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
      }'
    ```
    
    âœ… Your request is authenticated and routed to the provider!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Security Warning**: Without authentication enabled or limited network access, anyone with access to your AI Gateway can use your provider API keys. Enable Helicone authentication to secure your deployment.
</Warning>

## Authentication Usage

Configure `helicone.features` to control authentication and observability:

- **`none`** - No authentication or observability
- **`auth`** - Authentication only
- **`observability`** - Authentication + observability

When authentication is enabled, include your Helicone API key with every request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/router/my-router/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-abc123def456" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

The gateway validates keys in real-time through a persistent WebSocket connection to Helicone's control plane. Keys are cached locally for resilience during network issues.

<Note>
  For complete configuration options, see the [Configuration Reference](/ai-gateway/config#helicone-add-ons).

## Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Production - Secure">
    **Use case:** Production deployment requiring authentication.

    ```yaml
    helicone:
      # Set to `features: observability` to enable observability and auth
      features: auth
    ```
    
    **Environment variables:**
    ```bash
    HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```

    **Result:** All requests require valid Helicone API keys for access.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Helicone">
    **Use case:** Using a self-hosted Helicone instance with custom endpoints.

    ```yaml
    helicone:
      # Set to `features: observability` to enable observability and auth
      features: auth
      base-url: "https://helicone.your-domain.com"
      websocket-url: "wss://helicone.your-domain.com/ws/v1/router/control-plane"
    ```
    
    **Environment variables:**
    ```bash
    HELICONE_CONTROL_PLANE_API_KEY=sk-helicone-your-api-key
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secure Network - Auth Disabled">
    **Use case:** Deployment within a secure network (VPN, private cloud) where network-level access control provides security.

    ```yaml
    helicone:
      authentication: false
      observability: false
    ```
    
    **Result:** No authentication required. Network security controls access.
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## How Authentication Works

When enabled, the AI Gateway connects to Helicone's control plane for real-time authentication validation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="WebSocket Connection">
    Gateway establishes persistent connection to Helicone control plane with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="API Key Sync">
    Authorized API keys and user data are cached locally for fast validation and resilience during network issues
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request Validation">
    Incoming requests are validated against cached keys with graceful degradation - cached keys continue working during temporary connectivity issues
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Control">
    Only requests with valid Helicone API keys are allowed through to your provider APIs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security

**Access Control:** Requests without valid Helicone API keys are rejected with 401 Unauthorized. Your provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) remain secure in the gateway environment and are never transmitted to Helicone.

**Secure Communication:** All data transmission to Helicone uses TLS encryption for secure key validation.

## Coming Soon

The following authentication integrations are planned for future releases:

| Provider | Description | Version |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | Secure API key storage and rotation with AWS IAM integration | v1 |
| **Azure Key Vault** | Microsoft Azure's cloud key management service | v1 |
