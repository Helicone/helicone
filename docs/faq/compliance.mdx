### What options are available for high compliance concerns?

Helicone offers several solutions for organizations with strict compliance needs:

1. **Comprehensive Security Measures:** Explore our [Data and Security](/references/data-autonomy) section for details on SOC 2 compliance and other security protocols.
2. **Data Residency Choices:** Ensure GDPR compliance by selecting between US and EU data regions.
3. **Request and Response Privacy:** Use our [Omit Logs feature](/features/advanced-usage/omit-logs) to prevent storing request and response bodies in long-term storage.
4. **Asynchronous Logging:** Implement our [async logging solution](/references/proxy-vs-async#async) to capture metadata (tokens, latency, time to first token) without storing actual content.
5. **Self-Hosting Solutions:** Consider our [self-hosting options](/getting-started/self-host) to maintain complete control over your data environment.
