## What is this?

This is a small utility that helps you clean a tree by removing some stuff.

## When should I use this?

You can use this utility to remove things from a tree.
This utility is very similar to [`unist-util-filter`][unist-util-filter], which
creates a new tree.
Modifying a tree like this utility `unist-util-remove` does is much faster on
larger documents though.

You can also walk the tree with [`unist-util-visit`][unist-util-visit] to remove
nodes.
To create trees, use [`unist-builder`][unist-builder].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+ and 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unist-util-remove
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {remove} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-remove@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {remove} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-remove@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {u} from 'unist-builder'
import {remove} from 'unist-util-remove'

const tree = u('root', [
  u('leaf', '1'),
  u('parent', [
    u('leaf', '2'),
    u('parent', [u('leaf', '3'), u('other', '4')]),
    u('parent', [u('leaf', '5')])
  ]),
  u('leaf', '6')
])

// Remove all nodes of type `leaf`.
remove(tree, 'leaf')

console.dir(tree, {depth: null})
```

Yields:

```js
{
  type: 'root',
  children: [
    {
      type: 'parent',
      children: [{type: 'parent', children: [{type: 'other', value: '4'}]}]
    }
  ]
}
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the parent of leaf `5` is also removed, `options.cascade` can
> change that.

## API

This package exports the identifier [`remove`][api-remove].
There is no default export.

### `remove(tree[, options], test)`

Change the given `tree` by removing all nodes that pass `test`.

The tree is walked in *[preorder][]* (NLR), visiting the node itself, then its
head, etc.

###### Parameters

*   `tree` ([`Node`][node])
    â€” tree to change
*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    â€” configuration
*   `test` ([`Test`][test], optional)
    â€” `unist-util-is` compatible test

###### Returns

A changed given `tree`, without nodes that pass `test`.

`null` is returned if `tree` itself didnâ€™t pass the test or is cascaded away.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `cascade` (`boolean`, default: `true`)
    â€” whether to drop parent nodes if they had children, but all their children
    were filtered out

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
