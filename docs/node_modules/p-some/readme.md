```js
import got from 'got';
import pSome from 'p-some';

const input = [
	got.head('github.com').then(() => 'github'),
	got.head('google.com').then(() => 'google'),
	got.head('twitter.com').then(() => 'twitter'),
	got.head('medium.com').then(() => 'medium')
];

const [first, second] = await pSome(input, {count: 2});

console.log(first, second);
//=> 'google twitter'
```

## API

### pSome(input, options)

Returns a [cancelable `Promise`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-cancelable) that is fulfilled when `count` promises from `input` are fulfilled. The fulfilled value is an `Array` of the values from the `input` promises in the order they were fulfilled. If it becomes impossible to satisfy `count`, for example, too many promises rejected, it will reject with an [`AggregateError`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/aggregate-error) error.

If you pass in cancelable promises, specifically promises with a `.cancel()` method, that method will be called for the promises that are still unfulfilled when the returned `Promise` is either fulfilled or rejected.

##### count
