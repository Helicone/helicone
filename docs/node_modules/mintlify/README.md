### 🚀 Installation

Download the Mintlify CLI using the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

### 👩‍💻 Development

#### `mintlify dev`
Run this command at the root of your Mintlify project to preview changes locally.

Notes

- `mintlify dev` requires Node v18 or higher.

#### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

#### Troubleshooting

Steps you can take if the dev CLI is not working (After each step try to run `mintlify dev` again):

- Make sure you are running in a folder with a `mint.json` file.
- Run `npm update -g mintlify` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- Make sure you are using Node v18 or higher.
- Navigate to the `.mintlify` folder in your home directory and delete its contents.

### Additional Commands
#### `mintlify broken-links` <sup>BETA</sup>
Check for broken internal links in your Mintlify project.

#### `mintlify rename <from> <to>` <sup>BETA</sup>
