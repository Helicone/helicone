## What is this?

This package is a utility that takes a [hast][] node and gets its plain-text
value.
It is like the DOMs `Node#innerText`, which is a bit nicer than
`Node#textContent`, because this turns `<br>` elements into line breaks and
uses `'\t'` (tabs) between table cells.

There are some small deviations from the spec, because the DOM has knowledge of
associated CSS, and can take into account that elements have `display: none` or
`text-transform` association with them, and this utility can‚Äôt do that.

## When should I use this?

This is a small utility that is useful when you want a plain-text version of a
node that is close to how it‚Äôs ‚Äúvisible‚Äù to users.

This utility is similar to [`hast-util-to-string`][hast-util-to-string], which
is simpler, and more like the `Node#textContent` algorithm discussed above.

There is also a package [`hast-util-from-text`][hast-util-from-text], which sort
of does the inverse: it takes a string, sets that as text on the node, while
turning line endings into `<br>`s

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+ or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install hast-util-to-text
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {toText} from "https://esm.sh/hast-util-to-text@3"
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {toText} from "https://esm.sh/hast-util-to-text@3?bundle"
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {h} from 'hastscript'
import {toText} from 'hast-util-to-text'

const tree = h('div', [
  h('h1', {hidden: true}, 'Alpha.'),
  h('article', [
    h('p', ['Bravo', h('br'), 'charlie.']),
    h('p', 'Delta echo \t foxtrot.')
  ])
])

console.log(toText(tree))
```

Yields:

```txt
Bravo
charlie.

Delta echo foxtrot.
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`toText`][totext].
There is no default export.

### `toText(tree[, options])`

Get the plain-text value of a node.

###### Parameters

*   `tree` ([`Node`][node])
    ‚Äî tree to turn into text
*   `options` ([`Options`][options], optional)
    ‚Äî configuration

###### Returns

Serialized `tree` (`string`).

###### Algorithm

*   if `tree` is a [comment][], returns its `value`
*   if `tree` is a [text][], applies normal whitespace collapsing to its
    `value`, as defined by the [CSS Text][css] spec
*   if `tree` is a [root][] or [element][], applies an algorithm similar to the
    `innerText` getter as defined by [HTML][]

###### Notes

> üëâ **Note**: the algorithm acts as if `tree` is being rendered, and as if
> we‚Äôre a CSS-supporting user agent, with scripting enabled.

*   if `tree` is an element that is not displayed (such as a `head`), we‚Äôll
    still use the `innerText` algorithm instead of switching to `textContent`
*   if descendants of `tree` are elements that are not displayed, they are
    ignored
*   CSS is not considered, except for the default user agent style sheet
*   a line feed is collapsed instead of ignored in cases where Fullwidth, Wide,
    or Halfwidth East Asian Width characters are used, the same goes for a case
    with Chinese, Japanese, or Yi writing systems
*   replaced elements (such as `audio`) are treated like non-replaced elements

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

##### Fields

*   `whitespace` ([`Whitespace`][whitespace], default: `'normal'`)
    ‚Äî default whitespace setting to use

### `Whitespace`

Valid and useful whitespace values (from [CSS][]) (TypeScript type).

##### Type

```ts
type Whitespace = 'normal' | 'pre' | 'nowrap' | 'pre-wrap'
```

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`Options`][options] and
[`Whitespace`][whitespace].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

`hast-util-to-text` does not change the syntax tree so there are no
openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
