  <b>Recomendation: Model Override</b>

  When using Azure, the model displays differently than expected at times. We have implemented logic to parse out the model, but if you want to guarantee your model is consistent, we highly recommend using model override:

  <code>Helicone-Model-Override: [MODEL_NAME]</code>
