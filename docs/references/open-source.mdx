description: "Understanding Helicone's open-source status and how to contribute"
---

Helicone is committed to being an open-source project. We believe in the power of open source for several key reasons:

1. **Transparency**: We want our users to understand exactly how our software works and be able to trust it fully.

2. **Giving Back**: We've benefited immensely from the open-source community, and this is our way of contributing back.

3. **Ease of Self-Hosting and Contribution**: Open source makes it simpler for users to self-host Helicone and for developers to contribute to its improvement.

4. **Preventing Vendor Lock-In**: We believe users should have the freedom to modify and control the software they rely on.

5. **Execution as the True Differentiator**: We're confident that our value lies not just in our code, but in how we execute and support our product.
