## Robust Cloud Security

At Helicone, we prioritize the security and privacy of your data with our comprehensive cloud solution:

1. **SOC2 Compliant**: Our cloud infrastructure adheres to SOC2 standards, ensuring rigorous security, availability, and confidentiality controls.
2. **Regional Availability**: Choose between EU and US regions to meet your data residency and compliance requirements.
3. **OWASP Protocols**: We implement the latest OWASP security protocols to protect against common vulnerabilities and threats.
4. **Secure Key Encryption**: Provider keys are encrypted using industry-leading methods. Learn more about our encryption practices [here](/features/advanced-usage/vault#how-we-encrypt-your-provider-key-securely).

## Embrace Data Ownership

Helicone's open-source solution empowers you with full control over your data, ensuring security and complete ownership.

## Why Data Ownership Matters

Managing sensitive or confidential information requires complete control. For example, healthcare providers safeguarding patient data cannot afford vulnerabilities from third-party servers. With Helicone, you maintain secure handling and ownership of your data.

## Achieve Data Autonomy with Helicone

Every organization has unique needs requiring tailored solutions. Helicone is dedicated to guiding you toward data autonomy.
