## What is Thread-of-Thought prompting

Thread of Thought is an approach that extends [chain-of-thought prompting](use-chain-of-thought-prompting) by maintaining a continuous, evolving reasoning process across multiple, related prompts.
It's like having a conversation where each new idea builds on previous ones, helping the LLM to think more deeply and keep track of all the details as we explore a topic.

## How to implement Thread-of-Thought prompting

1. **Provide templates.** Offer a clear structure (e.g., headings, bullet points).
2. **Use labels & delimiters.** Clearly mark sections for easier parsing.
3. **Follow conventions.** For instance, use Markdown headings or JSON keys.

## Example

```
Initial Prompt:
"Letâ€™s create an app to improve community health. Start by suggesting a target audience we could focus on."

Model responds with a target audience, e.g., senior citizens.

```

## Why use Thread-of-Thought prompting

- **Coherent reasoning:** Promotes logical flow over time.
- **Improved context handling:** Builds upon previously established knowledge.
- **Better problem decomposition:** Breaks large challenges into manageable steps.
- **Flexibility:** Adapts reasoning based on evolving information.
- **Natural interaction:** Mimics human-like thought progression.

## Tips for Effective Thread-of-Thought Prompting

- Begin with a well-defined initial prompt.
- Encourage referencing of earlier points as needed.
- Periodically summarize key points to maintain focus.
- Regularly filter or refocus context to avoid overload.
- Structured Progression: Move through logical phases of reasoning.
- Allow revision of earilier ideas to refine them.
