## How to be specific and clear

The rule of thumb is to provide just enough instructions and context to help guide the AIâ€™s response. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be direct and state exactly what you want (i.e. summary, list, explanation).
2. Mention the audience and tone.
3. Ask for one thing at a time. Avoid overloading your prompt with multiple questions.

## Examples
