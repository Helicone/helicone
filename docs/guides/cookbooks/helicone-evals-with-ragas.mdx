Helicone's Datasets and Fine Tuning feature can be used in combination with Ragas to provide evals for your LLM application.

# Prerequisites

If you wish to evaluate on real requests follow the [quick start documentation](https://docs.helicone.ai/getting-started/quick-start). For this tutorial, the Helicone demo will be used, which contains mock request data.

Follow the [dataset documentation](https://docs.helicone.ai/features/fine-tuning) to add LLM responses to a dataset. Then, download the dataset as a CSV by clicking the "export data" button on the upper right hand corner. This will output a CSV with the following columns: `_type,id,schema,preview,model,raw,heliconeMetadata`.

# Human Labeling

Add a column to the CSV exported from Helicone with `mock_data` which includes [gold answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69515119/what-does-gold-mean-in-nlp).
Below is an example script which augments the CSV exported from Helicone with an additional column. It will copy the LLM's response into the golden answer column as a placeholder. Then, replace each of the column's cells with the correct output corresponding to the user input.

Adding gold answer column to the CSV:

```python
"""
add_mock_gold.py

Takes your existing data.csv, parses the model’s response,
and writes out data_with_gold.csv with a new `gold_answer` column
that simply mirrors the model’s own answer (so that you can test your evaluation pipeline).
"""

import pandas as pd
import json

# 1. Read the original CSV
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# 2. Build a list of “mock” gold answers by copying the model’s response
gold_answers = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    # Parse the “choices” JSON string and extract the assistant’s text
    choices = json.loads(row["choices"])
    assistant_text = choices[0]["message"]["content"]
    gold_answers.append(assistant_text)

# 3. Add the new column
df["gold_answer"] = gold_answers

# 4. Write out a new CSV
df.to_csv("data_with_gold.csv", index=False)

print(f"✅ Wrote {len(df)} rows to data_with_gold.csv, each with a mock gold_answer.")

```

# Defining Metrics

Ragas provides several metrics with which to evaluate LLM responses. The below script showcases how to take in as input the human annotated CSV, then evaluate based on the [answer correctness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/answer_correctness/) and [semantic answer similarity](https://docs.ragas.io/en/v0.1.21/concepts/metrics/semantic_similarity.html) metric.

```python
"""
evaluate_llm_outputs.py

Script to evaluate LLM outputs using Ragas.

Prerequisites:
    pip install ragas pandas datasets
"""

import pandas as pd
import json
from ragas import evaluate
from ragas.metrics import answer_correctness, answer_similarity
from datasets import Dataset
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# 1. Load your CSV data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# 2. Build the evaluation dataset in Ragas's expected format
eval_data = {
    'question': [],
    'answer': [],
    'ground_truth': []
}

for _, row in df.iterrows():
    # Extract the prompt/question
    prompt = row['messages']

    # Parse the "choices" JSON and pull out the assistant's response text
    choices = json.loads(row['choices'])
    response = choices[0]['message']['content']

    # Check for gold_answer column
    if 'gold_answer' in df.columns and not pd.isna(row['gold_answer']):
        gold_answer = row['gold_answer']
    else:
        raise KeyError(
            "Column 'gold_answer' not found or contains NaN. "
            "Evaluation metrics require a reference answer. "
            "Please add a 'gold_answer' column to your CSV."
        )

    eval_data['question'].append(prompt)
    eval_data['answer'].append(response)
    eval_data['ground_truth'].append(gold_answer)

# 3. Convert to Dataset format
dataset = Dataset.from_dict(eval_data)

# 4. Define metrics (using available ragas metrics)
metrics = [
    answer_correctness,
    answer_similarity
]

# 5. Run the evaluation
results = evaluate(
    dataset=dataset,
    metrics=metrics
)

# 6. Output the results
results_df = results.to_pandas()
print(results_df)

# 7. Save to CSV
results_df.to_csv('evaluation_results.csv', index=False)

```

This will output a result containing the correctness and semantic similarity metrics for those LLM responses:

## Performance Metrics

Scores generated by Ragas or other evaluation tools can be added directly into Helicone. This can be done either through the UI or through the Helicone request/response API.

### UI

Click on any request within the requests page, then add properties with your metrics for each respective request. Refer to https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties for more information.

### Helicone Scoring API

Follow https://docs.helicone.ai/rest/request/post-v1request-score and annotate each respective request with the score generated from Ragas.

Here is an example script which submits scores outputted from Ragas to annotate each corresponding request:

```python
"""
score_requests.py

Script to post score metrics to Helicone API for multiple requests.

Prerequisites:
    pip install pandas requests python-dotenv

Usage:
    1. Export your Helicone API key:
         export HELICONE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
    2. Ensure your `evaluation_results.csv` has at least these columns:
         - requestId
         - answer_correctness
         - semantic_similarity
    3. Run:
         python score_requests.py
"""

import os
import json
import requests
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load HELICONE_API_KEY from .env or environment
load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("HELICONE_API_KEY")
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("Please set the HELICONE_API_KEY environment variable")

# Base URL template for Helicone scoring endpoint
BASE_URL = "https://api.helicone.ai/v1/request/{request_id}/score"

def post_scores(request_id: str, scores: dict):
    """POST the given scores dict to Helicone for a single request."""
    url = BASE_URL.format(request_id=request_id)
    payload = {"scores": scores}
    headers = {
        "authorization": API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    resp = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if resp.ok:
        print(f"[✔] {request_id} → {scores}")
    else:
        print(f"[✖] {request_id} → {resp.status_code} {resp.text}")

def main():
    # 1. Load your Ragas evaluation results
    df = pd.read_csv("evaluation_results.csv")

    # 2. Validate presence of requestId
    if 'requestId' not in df.columns:
        raise KeyError("CSV must contain a 'requestId' column")

    # 3. Determine which columns are your metric scores
    #    (everything except requestId and any other metadata)
    skip = {'requestId', 'user_input', 'response', 'reference'}
    score_cols = [c for c in df.columns if c not in skip]

    if not score_cols:
        raise ValueError("No metric columns found to send as scores")

    # 4. Iterate and post
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        rid = row['requestId']
        scores = {col: float(row[col]) for col in score_cols}
        post_scores(rid, scores)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Trace Annotation and Annotation Queues

We have developed the infrastructure for annotating evaluation traces and managing annotation queues, improving accuracy, traceability, and collaboration during evaluations. We will build out the UI further within the Helicone platform to better support attachment of feedback to specific runs, grouping runs together, and providing feedback on these group runs.

## Data Exports for Evals

We plan to add better data export controls to support evals with performance and task metrics as part of the export. This will enable easier integration with third parties such as Ragas.

## Response and Task Metrics

On our roadmap is targeted evaluation metrics for assessing response quality and task-specific performance, such as evaluating whether an agent selected the correct tool or used a tool correctly given a scenario the agent is tasked to complete.
