Track and optimize your LLM costs across all providers. Helicone provides detailed cost analytics and optimization tools to help you manage your AI budget effectively.

## How We Calculate Costs

Helicone uses two systems for cost calculation depending on your integration method:

### AI Gateway (100% Accurate)
When using Helicone's AI Gateway, we have complete visibility into model usage and calculate costs precisely using our [Model Registry v2](https://helicone.ai/models) system.

### Best Effort (Without Gateway)
For direct provider integrations, we use our open-source cost repository with pricing for 300+ models. This provides best-effort cost estimates based on model detection and token counts.

<Note>
**Cost not showing?** If your model costs aren't supported, [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HwUbV3Q8qz) or email [help@helicone.ai](mailto:help@helicone.ai) and we'll add support quickly.

## Understanding Unit Economics

The most critical aspect of cost tracking is understanding your unit economics - what drives costs in your application and how to optimize them.

### Sessions: Your Cost Foundation

[Sessions](/features/sessions) group related requests to show the true cost of user interactions. Instead of seeing individual API calls, you see complete workflows:

```typescript
// Track a complete customer support interaction
const response = await client.chat.completions.create(
  { 
    model: "gpt-4o", 
    messages: [...] 
  },
  {
    headers: {
      "Helicone-Session-Id": "support-ticket-123",
      "Helicone-Session-Name": "Customer Support"
    }
  }
);
```

This reveals insights like:
- A support chat costs $0.12 on average with 5 API calls
- Document analysis workflows cost $0.45 with 12 API calls
- Quick queries cost $0.02 with a single call

### Segmentation That Matters

Use [custom properties](/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties) to slice costs by the dimensions that matter to your business:

<Frame caption="Cost breakdown by user tier showing premium users generate 3x more value than cost">
  <img
    src="/images/custom-properties/properties-page.webp"
    alt="Dashboard showing cost segmentation by user tiers with ROI analysis"
  />
</Frame>

```typescript
headers: {
  "Helicone-Property-UserTier": "premium",
  "Helicone-Property-Feature": "document-analysis",
  "Helicone-Property-Environment": "production"
}
```

Now you can answer questions like:
- Do premium users justify their higher usage costs?
- Which features are cost-efficient vs. cost-intensive?
- How much are we spending on development vs. production?

## AI Gateway Cost Optimization

The [AI Gateway](/gateway/overview) doesn't just track costs - it actively optimizes them through intelligent routing.

### Automatic Model Selection

The [Model Registry](https://helicone.ai/models) shows all supported models with real-time pricing across providers. The AI Gateway automatically sorts by cost to find the cheapest option:

<Frame caption="Model Registry showing price comparison across providers">
  <img
    src="/images/model-selection.webp"
    alt="Helicone Model Registry interface showing models sorted by price across different providers"
  />
</Frame>

### How Automatic Optimization Works

1. **[BYOK Priority](/gateway/provider-routing#option-2-your-own-keys-byok)** - Uses your existing credits first (AWS, Azure, etc.)
2. **[Cost-Based Routing](/gateway/provider-routing#smart-routing-algorithm)** - Automatically selects the cheapest available provider
3. **[Smart Fallbacks](/gateway/provider-routing#failover-triggers)** - If one provider fails, routes to the next cheapest option

```typescript
// One request, multiple potential providers
await gateway.chat.completions.create({
  model: "claude-3.5-sonnet",
  messages: [...]
});

// Gateway automatically routes to cheapest available:
// 1. Your AWS Bedrock key ($3/1M tokens)
// 2. Your Anthropic key ($3/1M tokens)
// 3. Next cheapest provider...
```

## Cost Prevention & Alerts

<Frame caption="Cost alert configuration with spending thresholds and real-time notifications">
  <img
    src="/images/alerts/alert-triggered.webp"
    alt="Alert configuration interface showing daily and monthly spending limits"
  />
</Frame>

### Setting Smart Alerts

Configure [cost alerts](/features/alerts) to catch spending issues before they become problems. Set graduated thresholds (50%, 80%, 95% of budget) and use different limits for development vs. production environments.

The key is understanding your baseline spending patterns and setting alerts that give you time to react without causing alert fatigue.

<Note>
Cost alerts rely on accurate cost data. See [How We Calculate Costs](#how-we-calculate-costs) above. If you see "cost not supported" for your model, [contact us](https://discord.com/invite/HwUbV3Q8qz) to add support.
</Note>

### Caching for Cost Reduction

Enable [caching](/features/advanced-usage/caching) to eliminate redundant API calls entirely:

<Frame caption="Cache performance showing 73% hit rate saving $1,247 this month">
  <img
    src="/images/caching.webp"
    alt="Dashboard showing cache hit rates and associated cost savings"
  />
</Frame>

```typescript
headers: {
  "Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true",
  "Cache-Control": "max-age=3600"  // 1 hour cache
}
```

Best caching opportunities:
- FAQ responses in support bots
- Static content generation
- Development and testing environments



## Automated Reports

Get regular cost summaries delivered to your inbox or Slack channels. Reports provide insights into spending trends, model usage, and optimization opportunities.

### What Reports Include
- Weekly spending summaries and trends
- Model usage breakdown by cost
- Top cost drivers and expensive requests
- Week-over-week comparisons
- Optimization recommendations

### Setting Up Reports
Configure automated reports in **Settings â†’ Reports** to receive them via:
- **Email** - Weekly digests to any email address
- **Slack** - Post to your team channels

<Note>
Reports help you stay on top of costs without checking the dashboard daily. Perfect for finance teams and engineering managers tracking AI spend.
