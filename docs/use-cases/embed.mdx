<Tip>

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

</Tip>

Here are some common HTML tags that are used for documentation

## Embed

### iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document. Most commonly used for embedding videos.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"> </iframe>
```

To have videos autoplay, add `autoplay = {true}`.

<Tip>
  Additionally, we support mp4 files up to 5 MB and you can also upload your
  videos to storage services like Cloudinary to reference them in your Mintlify
  documentation!
</Tip>

### Images

Insert an image onto the page. Used over the standard [markdown image syntax](/writing-content/image-embeds#using-markdown) for more control over the image styling.

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Line Breaks

Add a linebreak

```html
<br />
```
