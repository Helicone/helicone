In the following example we are going to show you what it looks like to resell a model using Helicone as your platform.

Let's say you are finetuning a model and it is hosted on hugging and you want to be able to sell that model to certain customers.
However, you don't want to build out

- dashboards to monitor the model
- API management
- rate limits
- billing
- authentication
- etc

How would you go about using Helicone's platform to do this?

### Step 1: Create a Model and deploy to an endpoint

You can do this using HuggingFace or any other model hosting platform.

### Step 2: Add your own top level domain on Helicone

You will need to register a domain that you can give your customers to access your model.
Right now this process is manual, but we are working on automating it.

The domain will look something like `my-startup.helicone.ai`.

### Step 3: Create a new customer that you are going to sell the model to

You can do this by going to the `Customer Portal` tab and clicking `Add Customer`.

    src="/images/customer-portal/add-customer.png"
    alt="Adding a customer in Helicone's Customer Portal"
  />
</Frame>

Here you can create a new customer and give them access to your model, and set different limits on that customer, like spend or request limits

### Step 4: Authenticate your customer

Since our proxy lives on the edge and not within a secure network, we need to authenticate the customer before they can access the model.

You can do this by providing a `Provider Key`, which is simply a Bearer token that you will receive from the proxy when a customer makes a request.

The `Provider Key` can be anything you want! This is just a way to protect your public endpoint.

### Step 5: Give your customer access to your model

Once you created a `Customer Account` you can add your customers to their new account.

<Note>
  Optionally if you opt in, you can register your own deployment for the
  dashboard they can use to login. For example `dashboard.mystartup.com`.
</Note>

You can do this by clicking into a customer and clicking `Invite Members`.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/customer-portal/invite-members.png"
    alt="Inviting members in Helicone's Customer Portal"
  />
</Frame>

### Step 6: Customer makes a request to your model

Now that you have a customer account, a customer can make a request to your model, by logging into their dashboard.
You can preview their dashboard by clicking `View` on the customer account.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/customer-portal/preview.png"
    alt="Previewing the customer dashboard in Helicone's Customer Portal"
  />
</Frame>

Once you click view, you will be brought to a version of the Helicone that only your customer can see.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/customer-portal/customer-view.png"
    alt="Customer view in Helicone's Developer tab"
  />
</Frame>

Customers can now navigate to the `Developer` tab and mint a new key they can use to access your model.

<Tip>
  To go back to editting the customer, click the `Back to Portal` button on the
  top left.
</Tip>

### Step 7: How your customers will use your model

Now that your customer has a key, they can make a request simply by changing the baseUrl.

Here is an example of an OpenAI compatible model:

```python
client = OpenAI(
  api_key="your-api-key-here", # The api key they generated in the previous step
  base_url="https://my-startup.helicone.ai/v1",
)
```

That's it! Now your customers can use your model and you can charge them for it.
