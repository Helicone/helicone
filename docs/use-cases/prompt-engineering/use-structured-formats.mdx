## How to use structured formats

1. Provide a template or example output. 
2. Use clear delimiters and labels. For example, label sections and use delimiters to separate different parts of the response.
3. Use formatting conventions. For example, "generate a Markdown-formatted summary with headings and bullet points".


## Common structured formats

- **JSON/XML**: Ideal for data interchange between systems.
- **Bullet points/lists**: Useful for summaries or step-by-step instructions.
- **Tables**: Great for comparing data or presenting multiple related items.
- **Headings and subheadings**: Organizes content for readability, especially in longer texts.
- **Custom templates**: Tailored formats specific to your application's needs.


## Examples

  Issue Category: [Billing/Technical Support/General Inquiry]
  Priority Level: [High/Medium/Low]
  Suggested Response: [Your response to the customer]

  Customer query: I was charged twice for my subscription this month. Can you help fix this?
  ```
