Using [Custom Properties](features/advanced-usage/custom-properties),
you can segment your data in a variety of ways. This allows you to understand the costs and behavior of specific groups of users.

In this doc we are going to go over some recommend ways to segment your data.

## Segmenting Example

One of the most common ways to segment your data is by user type. For example,
you may want to understand the costs and behavior of your paying users vs your free users.

To do this, you can use the `user_type` property. This property is automatically set to `free` for all users, but you can set it to `paid` for your paying users.

```python
openai.Completion.create(
    # ...
    headers={
        "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "free",
    }
)
```

Segmenting gets even more powerful when you start combining it with other properties. For example,
you may want to understand the costs and behavior of your paying users and their usage of a specific feature.

```python
openai.Completion.create(
    # ...
    headers={
        "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
        "Helicone-Property-Feature": "spellcheck",
    }
)
```

Since you are able to add as many custom properties as you want, you can get very granular with your segments.

```python
openai.Completion.create(
    # ...
    headers={
        "Helicone-Property-User-Type": "paid",
        "Helicone-Property-Feature": "spellcheck",
        "Helicone-Property-Plan": "enterprise",
        "Helicone-Property-Job-UUID": "1234-5678-9012-3456",
    }
)
```
