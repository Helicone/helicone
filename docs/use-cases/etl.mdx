You can utilize our [GraphQL API](graphql/getting-started) to Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) data from Helicone into your own data warehouse.

Here are some benefits of our ETL API over traditional logging tools:

- Advanced User metrics
- Custom Properties with Segmentation metrics
- Comprehensive Request and Response parsing
  - Model
  - Prompt
  - Response
- Detailed Latency metrics
- Feedback results (coming soon)

## ETL Connectors (coming soon)

We currently do not offer any pre-built connectors. However, we are open to suggestions and eager to fulfill our users' requirements. If there is a specific connector you would like us to develop, please let us know. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zsSTcH2qhG) or submit a [Github issue](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/issues).

In the meantime, you can custom design your own ETL process using our [GraphQL API](graphql/getting-started).
