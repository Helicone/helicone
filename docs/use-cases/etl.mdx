<Warning>
  The GraphQL API is in beta and is subject to change, please use at your own
  discretion
</Warning>

You can use the [GraphQL API](graphql/getting-started) to ETL data out of Helicone into your own data
warehouse.

Some of the benefits of our ETL API over traditional logging tools are:

- User metrics
- Segmentation metric w/ Custom Properties
- Request and Reponse parsing
  - Model
  - Prompt
  - Response
- Latency metrics
- Feedback results (coming soon)

## ETL connectors (coming soon)

Currently we do not have any connectors, but we are taking requests. Please
contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zsSTcH2qhG), or submit a [Github issue](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/issues) for a connector you would like
to see.

In the meantime you can hand roll your own ETL process using the [GraphQL API](graphql/getting-started).
