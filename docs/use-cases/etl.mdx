<Warning>
  Please note that the GraphQL API is currently in its beta stage and may be subject to potential changes. We recommend using it with discretion.
</Warning>

Our [GraphQL API](graphql/getting-started) provides a robust solution for Extracting, Transforming, and Loading (ETL) data from Helicone into your personal data warehouse.

Here are some key advantages of our ETL API compared to traditional logging tools:

- Advanced User Metrics
- Custom Properties with Segmentation Metrics
- Comprehensive Request and Response Parsing
  - Model
  - Prompt
  - Response
- Detailed Latency Metrics
- Feedback Results (coming soon)

## ETL Connectors (coming soon)

At present, we do not offer any pre-built connectors. However, we are receptive to suggestions and committed to meeting our users' needs. If there is a specific connector you would like us to develop, please let us know. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zsSTcH2qhG) or submit a [Github issue](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/issues).

In the interim, you can design your own ETL process using our [GraphQL API](graphql/getting-started).
