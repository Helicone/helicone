## Table

### Creating a table

<Tip>

The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.
