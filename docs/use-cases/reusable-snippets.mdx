title: Reusable Snippets
description: Reusable, custom snippets to keep content in sync
---

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). This is a principle that we should apply to our documentation as well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating and using a custom snippet

1. Create a new file in the `_snippets` directory.
2. Construct your snippet content - it can be a component or a chunk of text.

```md _snippets/my-snippet.mdx
## My Snippet

This is my snippet.

<Info>I want to use this content in more than one place in my docs.</Info>
```

3. Navigate to the file where you want to use the snippet.
4. Add the snippet to the file using the following syntax:

```md destination-file.mdx
<Snippet file="my-snippet.mdx" />
```

<Note>
  You do not need to prepend the "_snippets" directory to the file name and you
  do not need to import the snippet.
