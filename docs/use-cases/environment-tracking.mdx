Many organizations utilize multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production. To distinguish between these environments, you can create a `Helicone-Property-Environment` property. In the example below, we assign the property "development" to the environment:

```python
openai.Completion.create(
    # ...
    headers={
        "Helicone-Property-Environment": "development",
    }
)
```

If you are using any other libraries or packages please refer to the [Custom Properties](/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties) documentation.

### Viewing Environments

Within the [request page](https://www.helicone.ai/requests), you can easily view all the environments that your organization has used. You can also filter by environment to view all the requests made in that environment.

Quickly add filters to your requests to view all the requests made in a specific environment.

Helicone also provides a dedicated page to view all the environments that your organization has used. You can also view the number of requests made in each environment.

Visit the [properties page](https://www.helicone.ai/properties) to view all the environments that your organization has used.
