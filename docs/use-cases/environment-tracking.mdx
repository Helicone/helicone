Many organizations operate across multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production. To differentiate these environments, you can establish a `Helicone-Property-Environment` property. In the example below, we assign the "development" property to the environment:

```python
openai.Completion.create(
    # ...
    headers={
        "Helicone-Property-Environment": "development",
    }
)
```

If you are utilizing any other libraries or packages, please refer to our [Custom Properties](/features/advanced-usage/custom-properties) documentation for guidance.

### Viewing Environments

On the [request page](https://www.helicone.ai/requests), you can conveniently view all the environments that your organization has employed.

</Frame>

Additionally, you can filter by environment to view all the requests made within that specific environment.

Efficiently add filters to your requests to view all the requests made in a particular environment.

Helicone also offers a dedicated page to view all the environments that your organization has utilized. You can also view the number of requests made in each environment.

Visit the [properties page](https://www.helicone.ai/properties) to view all the environments that your organization has employed.
