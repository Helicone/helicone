Retrieving user-specific requests can be done by building a request through the [Request API](/rest/request/post-v1requestquery). You can filter user requests by specifying different criteria.

## Retrieving Requests by User ID  

Here's an example to get all the requests where `user_id` is `abc@email.com`. 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.helicone.ai/v1/request/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-6hu2kbq-yoiuiry-qtc2hsa-rtif2pi' \
  --data '{
  "filter": {
    "request": {
      "user_id": {
        "equals": "abc@email.com" 
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

<Tip>By using the [Request API](/rest/request/post-v1requestquery), the code snippet will dynamically populate on the page, so you can copy and paste. </Tip>


## Adding Additional Filters  

You can structure your query to add any number of filters.

**Note**: To add multiple filters, change the filter to a branch and nest the ANDs/ORs as an abstract syntax tree. 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.helicone.ai/v1/request/query \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer sk-helicone-6hu2kbq-yoiuiry-qtc2hsa-rtif2pi' \
  --data '{
  "filter": {
    "operator": "and",
    "right": {
      "request": {
        "model": {
          "contains": "gpt-4"
        }
      }
    },
    "left": {
      "request": {
        "user_id": {
          "equals": "abc@email.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```


## Use Cases

- Monitor how users interact with your application, and get insights into usage patterns and behaviors. 
- Access user-specific requests to pinpoint the errors and resolve issues more efficiently. 
- Track the number of requests and associated costs per user to facilitate better cost control.
- Detect any unusual or potentially harmful behaviors to maintain the integrity of your application.
