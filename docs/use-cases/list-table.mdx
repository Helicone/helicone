## Lists
### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items

- First item

- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Creating a table

<Tip>

The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```md
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |
