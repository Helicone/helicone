# Data Ownership

Helicone being open-source allows its users to have complete ownership over their data by self deploying Helicone.

# When is data ownership important?

Data ownership is important when you want to have complete control over your data. This is especially important when you are dealing with sensitive data. For example, if you are a doctor and you want to store your patient's data, you would want to have complete control over the data. You would not want to store it on a third party server. This is where self hosting comes in. You can deploy Helicone on your own server and have complete control over your data.

# How do I get data autonomy for my organization?

Many organizations use cases are bespoke and require careful planning and execution. We at Helicone are happy to help you with your data autonomy journey.
