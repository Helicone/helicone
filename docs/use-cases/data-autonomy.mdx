## The Power of Data Ownership

Being an open-source solution, Helicone entrusts its users with complete ownership over their data by allowing self-deployment. Not only does this promise enhanced security, but it also puts you firmly in the driver's seat when it comes to your data management.

## Why is Data Ownership so Important?

Data ownership becomes critical when you desire absolute control over your information. It's particularly vital when dealing with sensitive data such as personal or confidential business information. Imagine being a healthcare provider entrusted with protecting your patients' data - you wouldn't want to rely on a third-party server with potential security risks. Self-hosting solutions, such as those offered by Helicone, allow you to deploy the software on your server, providing you with complete control and secure data handling.

## Achieving Data Autonomy for Your Organization

No two organizations are alike, and many will have unique use cases requiring bespoke planning and implementation. However, achieving data autonomy doesn't have to be a daunting task. Here at Helicone, we are committed to assisting you on this journey towards data independence.
