# Finding Errors

In Helicone, the request page allows you to filter results by status code, a unique number that corresponds to various states of web requests. Using this feature, you can conveniently locate errors, providing you with crucial information about when and where these mishaps occurred.

# Debugging prompts with Playground

Helicone provides a 'Playground' feature for debugging your 'prompt'. This tool allows you to test your prompt and quickly observe the model's output for minor adjustments within the Helicone environment. Here's a simple guide on how to use it:

1. Open a request.
