## What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that guides the model to articulate a step-by-step reasoning process when answering a question or solving a problem. Instead of providing a direct answer, the model is encouraged to "think out loud," detailing the intermediate steps that lead to the final conclusion.

## How to Implement Chain-of-Thought Prompting

1. **Instruct the model to show its work**: Explicitly ask the model to provide step-by-step reasoning.
2. **Provide examples with reasoning steps**: Demonstrate the desired approach by including examples that show the reasoning process.
3. **Use prompts that encourage explanation**: Incorporate phrases that prompt the model to elaborate.
4. **Leverage few-shot learning with Chain-of-Thought**: Combine CoT prompting with few-shot learning by providing examples that include reasoning steps.

## Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Example 1: Mathematical Problem Solving">
  This example demonstrates how requesting step-by-step solutions helps the model show its calculation process, reducing the chance of errors.

**Prompt:**

> Solve the following math problem step-by-step:
>
> If one book costs \$15 and you buy 4 books, how much do you spend in total?
>
> Answer:

**Model's response:**

> Let me solve this step by step:
> 1. Each book costs \$15
> 2. To find the total cost, I multiply the cost per book by the number of books
> 3. \$15/book Ã— 4 books = \$60
> Therefore, you spend \$60 in total.

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Example 2: Logical Reasoning">
  This example shows how Chain-of-Thought reasoning helps clarify relationships, leading to a clear conclusion.

**Prompt:**

> Provide a detailed explanation to solve this logic puzzle:
>
> Tom, Sarah, and Bill are siblings. Tom is older than Sarah. Sarah is older than Bill. Who is the youngest?
>
> Answer:

**Model's response:**

> Let me reason through this step by step:
> 1. Tom is older than Sarah
> 2. Sarah is older than Bill
> 3. This creates a clear age order: Tom (oldest), Sarah (middle), Bill (youngest)
> Therefore, Bill is the youngest sibling.

  <Accordion title="Example 3: Decision Making">
  This example illustrates how the model analyzes information and provides a justified recommendation through Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

**Prompt:**

> Help me decide whether to take an umbrella today. The weather forecast says there's a 60% chance of rain.
>
> Answer:

**Model's response:**

> Let me analyze this decision step by step:
> 1. The forecast shows a 60% chance of rain
> 2. This means rain is more likely than not (over 50% probability)
> 3. The consequence of not taking an umbrella if it rains is getting wet
> 4. The cost of carrying an umbrella is minimal
> Therefore, you should take an umbrella today as a precaution.

## Why Use Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- **Improves reasoning accuracy**: Helps the model handle complex queries by breaking them down into manageable steps.
- **Enhances transparency**: Provides insight into how the model arrives at an answer, which is valuable for verification and trust.
- **Facilitates error detection**: Makes it easier to identify and correct mistakes in the reasoning process.
- **Encourages detailed responses**: Generates richer and more informative outputs.

## Tips for Effective Chain-of-Thought Prompting

- Be explicit and direct in your request for step-by-step reasoning
- Provide clear examples that demonstrate the desired thought process
- Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed elaboration
- Maintain clarity and focus throughout the prompt
- Limit the scope for complex topics to prevent overwhelming responses
