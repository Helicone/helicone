<Warning>
<b>IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE</b>

This integration uses Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy software, which involves significant security and performance considerations. Before implementing this in your CI pipeline, please:

1. Review the detailed information in [tools/mitm-proxy](/tools/mitm-proxy)
2. Ensure you fully understand the security implications
3. Test thoroughly in a non-production environment first

</Warning>

# Integration with GitHub Actions on Ubuntu/Debian

You can maximize Helicone's capabilities by integrating it into your CI pipelines. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for incorporating Helicone into your GitHub Actions workflows.

## Setup Steps

Add the following configurations to your GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Initialize the proxy in your workflow:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helicone/helicone/main/mitmproxy.sh | bash -s start
```

2. Configure the required environment variables:

```yml
OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
HELICONE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HELICONE_API_KEY }}
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
HELICONE_CACHE_ENABLED: "true"
HELICONE_PROPERTY_<KEY>: <VALUE>
```

<Note>
You can also set these variables within your test files. For additional configuration options, refer to the [MITM proxy documentation](/tools/mitm-proxy).
</Note>

## Workflow Example

Here's a complete example of how to integrate Helicone in your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yml
# Your existing workflow configuration...
tests:
  steps:
    - name: Execute OpenAI Tests with Helicone
      run: |
        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helicone/helicone/main/mitmproxy.sh | bash -s start
        # Add your test execution commands here

      env:
        OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        HELICONE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.HELICONE_API_KEY }}
        REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
        HELICONE_CACHE_ENABLED: "true"
        HELICONE_PROPERTY_<KEY>: <VALUE>
```
