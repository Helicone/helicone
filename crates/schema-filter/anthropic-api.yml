        Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

        The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

        Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once cancellation is initiated, the batch enters a `canceling` state, at which time the system may complete any in-progress, non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.

        The number of canceled requests is specified in `request_counts`. To determine which requests were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that cancellation may not result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.

            Input messages.

            Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

            Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

            If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

            Example with a single `user` message:

            ```json
            [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
            ```

            Example with multiple conversational turns:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
            ]
            ```

            Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
            ]
            ```

            Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
            ```

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
            ```

            Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [
              {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                  "type": "base64",
                  "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                  "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
                }
              },
              {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
            ]}
            ```

            We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

            See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.

            Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter â€” there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

            There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

            System prompt.

            A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role. See our [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).
          examples:
          - - text: Today's date is 2024-06-01.
              type: text
          - Today's date is 2023-01-01.

        tools:

            Definitions of tools that the model may use.

            If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

            Each tool definition includes:

            * `name`: Name of the tool.
            * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
            * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

            For example, if you defined `tools` as:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                "input_schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                    }
                  },
                  "required": ["ticker"]
                }
              }
            ]
            ```

            And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_use",
                "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
              }
            ]
            ```

            You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "content": "259.75 USD"
              }
            ]
            ```

            Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

            See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

            If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

            Example with a single `user` message:

            ```json
            [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
            ```

            Example with multiple conversational turns:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
            ]
            ```

            Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
            ]
            ```

            Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
            ```

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
            ```

            Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [
              {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                  "type": "base64",
                  "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                  "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
                }
              },
              {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
            ]}
            ```

            We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

            See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.

            Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter â€” there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

            There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

            Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

            Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for details.

            Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

            Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn, which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

            If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"` and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

            System prompt.

            A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role. See our [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).
          examples:
          - - text: Today's date is 2024-06-01.

        temperature:

            Amount of randomness injected into the response.

            Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

            Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

        tools:
          description: |-
            Definitions of tools that the model may use.

            If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

            Each tool definition includes:

            * `name`: Name of the tool.
            * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
            * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

            For example, if you defined `tools` as:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                "input_schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                    }
                  },
                  "required": ["ticker"]
                }
              }
            ]
            ```

            And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_use",
                "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
              }
            ]
            ```

            You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "content": "259.75 USD"
              }
            ]
            ```

            Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

            See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

            Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

            Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

            In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

            Content generated by the model.

            This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

            Example:

            ```json
            [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
            ```

            If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

            For example, if the input `messages` were:
            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
            ]
            ```

            Then the response `content` might be:

            ```json
            [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
            ```
          examples:
          - - text: Hi! My name is Claude.

            * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
            * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools

            Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

            Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

            For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

            Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

        temperature:
          description: |-
            Amount of randomness injected into the response.

            Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

            Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.
          examples:
          - 1

            Use nucleus sampling.

            In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

            Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.
          examples:
          - 0.7

            Input messages.

            Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

            Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

            If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

            Example with a single `user` message:

            ```json
            [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
            ```

            Example with multiple conversational turns:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
            ]
            ```

            Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
            ]
            ```

            Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
            ```

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
            ```

            Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [
              {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                  "type": "base64",
                  "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                  "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
                }
              },
              {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
            ]}
            ```

            We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

            See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.

            Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter â€” there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

            There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

        tools:
          description: |-
            Definitions of tools that the model may use.

            If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

            Each tool definition includes:

            * `name`: Name of the tool.
            * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
            * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

            For example, if you defined `tools` as:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                "input_schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                    }
                  },
                  "required": ["ticker"]
                }
              }
            ]
            ```

            And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_use",
                "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
              }
            ]
            ```

            You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "content": "259.75 USD"
              }
            ]
            ```

            Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

            See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

            Input messages.

            Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

            Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

            If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

            Example with a single `user` message:

            ```json
            [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
            ```

            Example with multiple conversational turns:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
            ]
            ```

            Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
            ]
            ```

            Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
            ```

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
            ```

            Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [
              {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                  "type": "base64",
                  "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                  "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
                }
              },
              {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
            ]}
            ```

            We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

            See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.

            Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter â€” there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

            There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

            The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

            Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

            Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for details.

            Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

            Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn, which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

            If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"` and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

        temperature:

            Amount of randomness injected into the response.

            Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

            Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

        tools:
          description: |-
            Definitions of tools that the model may use.

            If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

            Each tool definition includes:

            * `name`: Name of the tool.
            * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
            * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

            For example, if you defined `tools` as:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                "input_schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                    }
                  },
                  "required": ["ticker"]
                }
              }
            ]
            ```

            And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_use",
                "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
              }
            ]
            ```

            You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "content": "259.75 USD"
              }
            ]
            ```

            Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

            See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

            Content generated by the model.

            This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

            Example:

            ```json
            [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
            ```

            If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

            For example, if the input `messages` were:
            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
            ]
            ```

            Then the response `content` might be:

            ```json
            [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
            ```
          examples:
          - - text: Hi! My name is Claude.

            * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
            * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools

            Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

            Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

            For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

            Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

            Input messages.

            Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

            Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

            If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

            Example with a single `user` message:

            ```json
            [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
            ```

            Example with multiple conversational turns:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
              {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
            ]
            ```

            Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

            ```json
            [
              {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
              {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
            ]
            ```

            Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
            ```

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
            ```

            Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

            ```json
            {"role": "user", "content": [
              {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                  "type": "base64",
                  "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                  "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
                }
              },
              {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
            ]}
            ```

            We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

            See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for more input examples.

            Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use the top-level `system` parameter â€” there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

            There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

            Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

            Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn, which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

            If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"` and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

            System prompt.

            A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role. See our [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).
          examples:
          - - text: Today's date is 2024-06-01.
              type: text
          - Today's date is 2023-01-01.

        temperature:
          description: |-
            Amount of randomness injected into the response.

            Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

            Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

        tools:
          description: |-
            Definitions of tools that the model may use.

            If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

            Each tool definition includes:

            * `name`: Name of the tool.
            * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
            * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

            For example, if you defined `tools` as:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                "input_schema": {
                  "type": "object",
                  "properties": {
                    "ticker": {
                      "type": "string",
                      "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                    }
                  },
                  "required": ["ticker"]
                }
              }
            ]
            ```

            And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_use",
                "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "name": "get_stock_price",
                "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
              }
            ]
            ```

            You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

            ```json
            [
              {
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                "content": "259.75 USD"
              }
            ]
            ```

            Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

            See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

            Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

            In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.
