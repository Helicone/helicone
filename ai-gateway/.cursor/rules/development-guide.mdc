# Development Guide

This document provides guidance for developing and testing the LLM Proxy.

## Setup

1. Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Install direnv: https://direnv.net
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy [.envrc.template](mdc:.envrc.template) to `.envrc`
   - Fill out the required API keys and configuration

## Running Locally

- Start the router: `cargo run`
- Test with a sample request: `cargo run -p test`

## File Structure Conventions

### Main Application
- [ai-gateway/src/main.rs](mdc:ai-gateway/src/main.rs) - Application entry point
- [ai-gateway/src/lib.rs](mdc:ai-gateway/src/lib.rs) - Library exports

### Tests
- [ai-gateway/tests/](mdc:ai-gateway/tests) - Integration tests
- [ai-gateway/src/tests/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/tests) - Test utilities
- Unit tests are typically located alongside the code they test

## Testing

- Run tests: `cargo test --all-features`

## Crate Organization

- Core application logic is in the [ai-gateway/](mdc:ai-gateway) directory
- Supporting libraries are in the [crates/](mdc:crates) directory
- External dependencies are defined in the root [Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml)
