# API Workflow and Patterns

This document outlines common patterns and the request workflow in the LLM Proxy.

## Request Flow

1. API request received by [ai-gateway/src/app.rs](mdc:ai-gateway/src/app.rs)
2. Middleware processing in [ai-gateway/src/middleware/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/middleware)
3. Routing via [ai-gateway/src/router/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/router)
4. Request dispatching in [ai-gateway/src/dispatcher.rs](mdc:ai-gateway/src/dispatcher.rs)
5. Provider selection via [ai-gateway/src/balancer/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/balancer)
6. Response processing and return

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling

- Errors are defined in [ai-gateway/src/error/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/error)
- Return structured errors to API clients

### Configuration

- Configuration is loaded from files and environment variables
- See [ai-gateway/src/config/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/config) for details

### Testing

- Unit tests alongside code
- Integration tests in [ai-gateway/tests/](mdc:ai-gateway/tests)
- Mock services for external APIs in [ai-gateway/stubs/](mdc:ai-gateway/stubs)
