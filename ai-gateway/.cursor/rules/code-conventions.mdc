# Code Conventions and Best Practices

This document outlines the code conventions and best practices used in the LLM Proxy codebase.

## Rust Conventions

- Use the 2024 edition of Rust as specified in [Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml)
- Follow the formatting rules in [rustfmt.toml](mdc:rustfmt.toml)
- Use clippy lints defined in the workspace configuration:
  - All clippy lints are set to "deny"
  - Pedantic lints are set to "warn"

## Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for defining error types
- Structured errors in [ai-gateway/src/error/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/error)

## Type Definitions

- Leverage Rust's type system for safety
- Common types in [ai-gateway/src/types/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/types)

## Testing Approaches

- Unit tests alongside the code they test
- Integration tests in separate directories
- Use the `serial_test` crate for tests that can't run in parallel
- Leverage the test utilities in [ai-gateway/src/tests/](mdc:ai-gateway/src/tests)

## Dependency Management

- Common dependencies are defined at the workspace level
- Version pinning for all dependencies
- Minimal dependency usage with feature flags when appropriate
