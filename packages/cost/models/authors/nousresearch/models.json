    "description": "DeepHermes 3 (Mistral 24B Preview) is an instruction-tuned language model by Nous Research based on Mistral-Small-24B, designed for chat, function calling, and advanced multi-turn reasoning. It introduces a dual-mode system that toggles between intuitive chat responses and structured “deep reasoning” mode using special system prompts. Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications.\n\nDeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *\"deep thinking\"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. \n\nSystem Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.\n",

    "description": "DeepHermes 3 Preview is the latest version of our flagship Hermes series of LLMs by Nous Research, and one of the first models in the world to unify Reasoning (long chains of thought that improve answer accuracy) and normal LLM response modes into one model. We have also improved LLM annotation, judgement, and function calling.\n\nDeepHermes 3 Preview is one of the first LLM models to unify both \"intuitive\", traditional mode responses and long chain of thought reasoning responses into a single model, toggled by a system prompt.",
