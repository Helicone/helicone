    "description": "Sarvam-M is a 24 B-parameter, instruction-tuned derivative of Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Base-2503, post-trained on English plus eleven major Indic languages (bn, hi, kn, gu, mr, ml, or, pa, ta, te). The model introduces a dual-mode interface: “non-think” for low-latency chat and a optional “think” phase that exposes chain-of-thought tokens for more demanding reasoning, math, and coding tasks. \n\nBenchmark reports show solid gains versus similarly sized open models on Indic-language QA, GSM-8K math, and SWE-Bench coding, making Sarvam-M a practical general-purpose choice for multilingual conversational agents as well as analytical workloads that mix English, native Indic scripts, or romanized text.",
