    description:
      "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B is a 70-billion parameter model created by distilling the reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek's flagship R1 model (671B parameters) into Meta's Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct base. It achieves exceptional performance on mathematical reasoning and coding benchmarks (94.5% on MATH-500, 1633 CodeForces rating), rivaling OpenAI's o1-mini while being fully open-source under MIT license. The model demonstrates that advanced reasoning patterns from larger models can be effectively transferred to smaller, more deployable architectures through knowledge distillation.",
