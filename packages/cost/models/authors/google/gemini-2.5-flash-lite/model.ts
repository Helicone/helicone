      'Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is a lightweight reasoning model in the Gemini 2.5 family, optimized for ultra-low latency and cost efficiency. It offers improved throughput, faster token generation, and better performance across common benchmarks compared to earlier Flash models. By default, "thinking" (i.e. multi-pass reasoning) is disabled to prioritize speed, but developers can enable it via the [Reasoning API parameter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens) to selectively trade off cost for intelligence.
