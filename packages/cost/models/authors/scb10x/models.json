    "description": "Llama3.1-Typhoon2-70B-Instruct is a Thai-English instruction-tuned language model with 70 billion parameters, built on Llama 3.1. It demonstrates strong performance across general instruction-following, math, coding, and tool-use tasks, with state-of-the-art results in Thai-specific benchmarks such as IFEval, MT-Bench, and Thai-English code-switching.\n\nThe model excels in bilingual reasoning and function-calling scenarios, offering high accuracy across diverse domains. Comparative evaluations show consistent improvements over prior Thai LLMs and other Llama-based baselines. Full results and methodology are available in the [technical report.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13702)",
