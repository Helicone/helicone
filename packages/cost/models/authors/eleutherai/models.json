    "description": "Llemma 7B is a language model for mathematics. It was initialized with Code Llama 7B weights, and trained on the Proof-Pile-2 for 200B tokens. Llemma models are particularly strong at chain-of-thought mathematical reasoning and using computational tools for mathematics, such as Python and formal theorem provers.",
