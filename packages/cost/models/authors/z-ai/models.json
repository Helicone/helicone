    "description": "GLM-4.5 is our latest flagship foundation model, purpose-built for agent-based applications. It leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and supports a context length of up to 128k tokens. GLM-4.5 delivers significantly enhanced capabilities in reasoning, code generation, and agent alignment. It supports a hybrid inference mode with two options, a \"thinking mode\" designed for complex reasoning and tool use, and a \"non-thinking mode\" optimized for instant responses. Users can control the reasoning behaviour with the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean.
