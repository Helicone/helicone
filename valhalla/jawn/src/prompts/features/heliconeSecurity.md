### Helicone Security

Helicone's security feature protects your LLM applications against prompt injections and other security threats.

Add these headers to the LLM request or provider initialization to enable security:

```
"Helicone-LLM-Security-Enabled": "true"
"Helicone-LLM-Security-Advanced": "true" // Optional
```
