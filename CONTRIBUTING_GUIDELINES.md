# Contributing to Helicone

There are many ways to contribute to Helicone. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/issues)
