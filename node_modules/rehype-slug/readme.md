## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin to add `id`s to headings.
It looks for headings (so `<h1>` through `<h6>`) that do not yet have `id`s
and adds `id` attributes to them based on the text they contain.
The algorithm that does this is [`github-slugger`][github-slugger], which
matches how GitHub works.

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.
**hast** is the HTML AST that rehype uses.
This is a rehype plugin that adds `id`s to headings in the AST.

## When should I use this?

This plugin is useful when you have relatively long documents and you want to be
able to link to particular sections.

A different plugin, [`rehype-autolink-headings`][rehype-autolink-headings], adds
links to these headings back to themselves, which is useful as it lets users
more easily link to particular sections.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-slug
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeSlug from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-slug@6'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeSlug from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-slug@6?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file `example.html`:

```html
<h1 id=some-id>Lorem ipsum</h1>
<h2>Dolor sit amet üò™</h2>
<h3>consectetur &amp; adipisicing</h3>
<h4>elit</h4>
<h5>elit</h5>
```

‚Ä¶and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {rehype} from 'rehype'
import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug'

const file = await rehype()
  .data('settings', {fragment: true})
  .use(rehypeSlug)
  .process(await read('example.html'))

console.log(String(file))
```

‚Ä¶then running `node example.js` yields:

```html
<h1 id="some-id">Lorem ipsum</h1>
<h2 id="dolor-sit-amet-">Dolor sit amet üò™</h2>
<h3 id="consectetur--adipisicing">consectetur &#x26; adipisicing</h3>
<h4 id="elit">elit</h4>
<h5 id="elit-1">elit</h5>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`rehypeSlug`][api-rehype-slug].

### `unified().use(rehypeSlug[, options])`

Add `id`s to headings.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    ‚Äî configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `prefix` (`string`, default: `''`)
    ‚Äî prefix to add in front of `id`s

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `rehype-slug@^6`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

This plugin works with `rehype-parse` version 1+, `rehype-stringify` version 1+,
`rehype` version 1+, and `unified` version 4+.

## Security

Use of `rehype-slug` can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attack as it sets `id` attributes on headings, which causes what is known
as ‚ÄúDOM clobbering‚Äù.
Please use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] and see its
[Example: headings (DOM clobbering)][rehype-sanitize-example] for information on
how to properly solve it.
