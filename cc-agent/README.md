This is an internal tool to autonomously run agents in a loop in github codespaces.

# Context

Github codespaces are an amazing product and we build codespaces periodically with the latest Helicone changes (see ../.devcontainer/\*) for more information on how these codespaces are generated.

_The idea_ is to spawn isolated github codespaces that can be easily used for agent loops, where they can run `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.

Github codespaces is an amazing tool because they have a CLI perfect for managing your environments and are preconfigured with git creds to allow you to push changes.

```bash
gh cs --help

# Getting started

```bash
# run the below gh cs create
> gh cs create
? Repository: Helicone/helicone
  âœ“ Codespaces usage for this repository is paid for by chitalian
? Branch (leave blank for default branch):
? Choose Machine Type: 4 cores, 16 GB RAM, 32 GB storage (Prebuild ready)
```

connect to it and open vscode with..

```bash
gh cs code
# or ssh instead if that's more your thing
gh cs ssh
```

Note this will run the build script which may take up to 5 minutes... be patient

edit the `src/task.md` file with the task you

The idea here is to run
