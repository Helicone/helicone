# Task to complete....

Can you run `act workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/e2e-test-suite.yml -j e2e-tests`

## and please get it to work...

You will run on a loop for the next 3 hours. good luck!

If everythig is working and you were able to test it manually, please create a doc in the scratchpad name "./.agent/DONE.md" with proof that everything works well and you were able to reproduce the error and the error is now fixed with a summary of the fixes and all the tests and builds are working

^ It's okay if you did not finish, we will re-run you in a min. Only write the DONE.md if you are 1000000% done

## MAKE SURE YOU ARE 100% done, if not DO NOT write the done file... really make sure...
